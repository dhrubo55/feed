                    <span>Hello, today, we&#x27;re going to talk about AVL tree.
Sometimes, the Binary search tree&#x27;s operations become O(n) instead of O(log n) due to being a skewed binary search tree, that&#x27;s why Adelson, Velskii and Landis. so what&#x27;s an AVL tree ?

if you&#x27;re not familiar with binary search tree, this post will help you :)
AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes. 
www.geeksforgeeks.org
The space complexity of the avl tree is O(n)



insert
search
delete




O(log n)
O(log n)
O(log n)



the difference between the height of left and right subtrees can be calculated using this formula below:
BalanceFactor &#x3D; height(left-sutree) ‚àí height(right-sutree)

if the balance factor was less than or equal to 1, the tree is balanced, if not, we use the rotation to make it balanced. There are four types of rotation:
Right rotation
Left rotation
Right-Left rotation
Left-Right rotation 
in the next post, we&#x27;ll cover rotation types with the implementation, see you tomorrow, have a great day!

So you want to write a book? Or maybe you don&#x27;t ‚Äî but you&#x27;ve certainly seen more and more developers in the community publishing their own books, right? Since I published my first eBook last winter, I&#x27;ve seen the number of self-published books boom. Let&#x27;s talk more about this format!
Books are a great vehicle for diving deep on a topic and having a very clear outcome for the reader. You have to map out clearly where you&#x27;re taking the reader and why, and you have to articulate what they&#x27;ll be able to do or learn at the very end of it.
Here are some tips I have for anyone who is thinking of writing a book.

                    <span>Now that you have worked and looked through the posts using higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and reduce(), you now get to apply them to solve a more complex challenge.


Complete the code for the squareList function using any combination of map(), filter(), and reduce(). The function should return a new array containing the squares of only the positive integers (decimal numbers are not integers) when an array of real numbers is passed to it. An example of an array of real numbers is [-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2].




const squareList &#x3D; arr &#x3D;&gt; {
  // Only change code below this line
  return arr;
  // Only change code above this line
};

const squaredIntegers &#x3D; squareList([-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2]);
console.log(squaredIntegers);

Hint: 
You will need to filter() the squareList for positive integers (decimals are not integers) and you will need to map()the values from your filter() function to a variable.
Answer:




const squareList &#x3D; arr &#x3D;&gt; {
  let positiveIntegersSquared &#x3D; arr.filter(num &#x3D;&gt; {
    if (Number.isInteger(num) &amp;&amp; num &gt; 0) {
      return num;
    } 
  })
    .map(num &#x3D;&gt; {
      return num * num
  });

  return positiveIntegersSquared;
};

const squaredIntegers &#x3D; squareList([-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2]);
console.log(squaredIntegers);

squareList([-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2]) should return [25, 9].</span>

Sometimes last year, around October, I came across this post1 about slack&#x27;s biggest redesign. It looked quite appealing to me and I tasked myself to make a clone of this page

using pure CSS3 and HTML5. I also wanted to ensure that it&#x27;s totally responsive irrespective of the screen size.
I am not fully into frontend stuff and hence not an expert. This was just for learning purposes. Comments, suggestions and constructive critism are welcome.
The full code for the clone is on github.

There were a great set of talks this year at Google IO 2021, one that piqued my interest was this talk on machine learning &amp; TensorFlow. There is a lot great new stuff here, but I&#x27;ll summarize some key points from a web perspective. 
 TensorFlow Lite models can now directly be run on the web in the browser üéâ
 Supports running all TFLite Task Library models for example image classification, objection detection, image segmentation and NLP
So I wanted to see how viable it is to use ML models on device in the browser.
TensorFlow.js is a library for machine learning in JavaScript and can be used both in the browser and Node.js. We can use this library to build, run and train supported models.

If you are a software developer then you must be familiar with Git. Git is vastly used for version/revision control for software development for controlling source code.
It is a distributed revision control system. Git is better than SVN for speed, data integrity and also support non-linear workflows. 
Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development purpose. Yes you read it correct.
he creator of the Linux kernel designed and developed Git. Git was initially used for updating source code of the Linux kernel from around the world. 
Like any other version control systems, every Git working directory has a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities.

                    <span>Written by Edidiong Asikpo ‚úèÔ∏è
It‚Äôs been well-documented that the human brain is hardwired for motion. Humans are more likely to pay attention to how elements move rather than focusing on static elements.
CSS animations take advantage of this human behavior. When animation is added to a website, it draws a user‚Äôs attention to important areas of a product, creating a lasting effect and generally enhancing experience.
In this post, we‚Äôll review the benefits of CSS animations, different CSS animation properties, and different examples where JavaScript developers can use CSS animations to make websites more interactive and user-friendly.
Each of these examples will be accompanied by a Codepen demo and a detailed explanation to make the examples more realistic, practical, and informative.

                    <span>JSON is the de facto standard for exchanging data on the Internet. It is relatively simple text format inspired by JavaScript. I say ‚Äúrelatively simple‚Äù because you can read and understand the entire JSON specification in minutes. Though JSON is a concise format, it is also better used over a slow network in compressed mode. ‚Ä¶ Continue reading Compressing JSON: gzip vs zstd</span>
