Swift Concurrency Support
Concurrency enables your apps to perform multiple tasks at the same time, which helps your apps stay responsive to user input while doing work in the background, like a weather app fetching forecast data while the user selects a city.



The problem? Swift never had native support for concurrent code, so it was unnecessarily difficult to write good concurrent code. Apple’s new approach to this is Structured Concurrency. Actors are an industry standard and are vital to safe concurrent programming.

In this article we will understand with examples and use cases.
In general, we use .then().catch() to handle promises:

fetch(url)
  .then(response=>response.json())
  .then(data=>console.log(data))
  .catch(error=>console.log(error));

Let's handle it using async await
We can write using function statement or function expression. Both will be valid, only difference is use of anonymous function in function expression.
//function statement
    async function getPosts(){
        const response = await fetch(url);
        const data = await response.json();

The .filter() method creates a new array with the values which is falling under the given condition from the existing array.

.map() method creates a new array and performs a particular function for each element in the array.

As the name suggests .sort() method helps us to sort the array according to our condition.
If we want to sort the companies according to their start years.

.sort() also makes a new array and the original array is un-touched.
.reduce() method reduces the whole array to a single value.

We have to give 0 to set the initial value from which the values will start although it is optional so you may skip it.
This is a bonus array method for y'all!
This method checks if the entered value is in the array or not.
Note: idexOf() is cases sensitive.

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a "pseudo" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.]]></summary>

Finer resolutions usually translate into lower energy usage and lower heat production. Given that many of our systems are limited by heat or power, finer resolutions lead to higher performance.

I wish to compute efficiently the number of matching characters (same position, same character). E.g., the strings ‘012c’ and ‘021c’ have two matching characters (‘0’ and ‘c’). The conventional approach in C would look as follow: uint64_t standard_matching_bytes(char * c1, char … Continue reading Counting the number of matching characters in two ASCII strings]]></summary>
