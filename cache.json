          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

So I’ve volunteered to speak about it and its use cases. The second reason is to practise using AWS CDK for C# more – I’ve mentioned a few times that there are very few examples in C#, and I thought it’s be a good idea to provide one more and hopefully make someone’s life easier.\nIn a nutshell, S3 Object Lambda allows you to amend the data that you usually get by using S3 Get requests.

This differs rather significantly from CommonJS (CJS), which is the module system that Node.js has shipped with for over a decade that make them relatively incompatible.\nThere are a number of different components of Node.js that have been intentionally structured to allow you to use standard (as in, how the ECMAScript Specification defines it) ESM by default and extend/augment that experience if you'd like to.\nToday, I want to get into one of the baisc elements of ESM in Node.js: the .mjs and .cjs extensions.\n.mjs (and .cjs)?\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  The Quick Answer\n\n\nThe straightforward answer to this is that having different file extensions allows yo…",

Being a bit OCD I studied everything I could to be a great salesperson. Zig Ziglar was my idol.  When I switched careers at 30 to software development, those negotiating tactics really paid off.\nI used these techniques to negotiate top pay, virtual office, travel and extensive fringe benefits for positions from software developer up to Chief Technology Officer but this works for any job position.\nThis video shows how to find out how much your job position pays.  Then goes over basic negotiating strategies and lastly advanced negotiating tips to not only getting more money but a better quality of life.",
