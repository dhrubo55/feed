One of the most beneficial ways to increase your chances of being selected for a data engineering position is to add well-documented portfolio of software projects to your resume.
It not only improves your skills but also provides a tangible final product you can discuss with your recruiter.
We previously shared an article that looked over 5 examples of data engineering projects you could take on. But what if you want to make your own?
Where should you start?
Often, finding the right dataset is the hardest part of putting together an effective project.

The question threw me off a bit because I didn't actually know the answer, even though I know that there are definitely patterns that I've used. Do those patterns have names? And why are the patterns I have been using better than others?
For today's post, I will be writing down my notes and thoughts as I learn about a variety of design patterns and how to implement them in JavaScript. Feel free to join me on my journey in this post, or make fun of my noob-ness as I discover something I feel like I should have learned already. (Better late than never, right?)

Let's assume we have a JSON file with the following data

I have truncated the data but it's basically a list of objects with a color and its corresponding hex value.
import json 

path_to_file = "data.json"
with open(path_to_file) as file:
    data = json.load(file)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cost of Cloud, a Trillion Dollar Paradox by Sarah Wang and Martin Casado makes two main arguments:
Cloud is the “perfect platform to optimize for innovation, agility, and growth, but it comes at a cost; there’s a ‘flexibility tax’ for the nimbleness the cloud provides.” Therefore, it’s critical to make cloud spend a first-class KPI metric, and empower engineering to optimize from day one.


As a company grows, the pressure that cloud puts on its margins “can start to outweigh the benefits.” Therefore, Wang and Casado present the idea of “repatriating” cloud workloads — bringing all or most out of the cloud.




The short version is: You’re crazy if you don’t start in the cloud, but you’re crazy if you stay on it.

The initial scale can be determined based on the widths of container and image:

Now we scale the image to that value by setting the transform style:

Create the range slider
First, we define the minimum and maximum scales and calculate the range step:

It's also possible to set the lower and upper values based on the initial scale. I set constant values to make this post simple.
The slider can update the value via the width of left part:

It happens when user drags the knob:

The VSCode IDE implements it's language support via the [Language Server Protocol][https://langserver.org/] which is designed to cleanly separate language support from the editor. For Perl a fully functional language server is implemented in  Perl::LanguageServer and will work with any LSP capable editor. 
VSCode can edit both locally or in a remote environment. This brief guide will get you started editing locally (i.e. on your desktop or laptop), however the Perl VSCode extension and Perl's LanguageServer will work in either scenario.

In computer science there’s the concept of queues. Queue is the set of messages that are meant to be delivered from one sender to one or more receivers. The messages can be delivered in order or out of order by design. The computer program that handles these transactions is called message broker. RabbitMQ is one the most popular message brokers that runs on top of Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). There are four main components forming AMQP protocol: Publisher, Exchange, Queue, Consumer.

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
