                    <span>Is it possible to import code in Node.js from HTTP(S) URLs just like in the browser or in Deno? After all, Node.js has had stable support for ECMAScript modules since version 14, released in April 2020. So what happens if we just write something like import(&#x27;https://cdn.skypack.dev/uuid&#x27;)?

Unfortunately it&#x27;s neither possible import code from HTTP URLs statically nor dynamically because the URL scheme is not supported.
An experimental feature of Node.js are custom loaders. A loader is basically a set of &quot;hook&quot; functions to resolve and load source code. There is even an example of an HTTP loader.
Such a loader would be passed to Node.js as a command line argument:
node --experimental-loader ./https-loader.mjs

A downside to this approach is that a loader&#x27;s influence is quite limited. For in…</span>

A complete implementation of the Stoffle programming language is available at GitHub. Feel free to open an issue if you find bugs or have questions.
In this blog post, we&#x27;re going to start implementing the interpreter for Stoffle, a toy programming language built entirely in Ruby. You can read more about this project in the first part of this series.
The interpreter we are going to build is commonly referred to as a tree-walk interpreter. In the previous post of this series, we built a parser to transform a flat sequence of tokens into a tree data structure (an abstract syntax tree, or AST for short). As you might be imagining, our interpreter has the job of going through the AST created by our par…</span>

                    <span>What is ZeroMQ? Sockets on steroids. If you are interested in the queue, (https://zeromq.org/). In fact, I can vouch for this personally. That&#x27;s why I am writing out how to do this little tutorial in how to make the message queues work.
What are we building? We are going to build a simple http logger with axios that sends a message to a queue through an event driven system that then can process the message.
Now create folder, mine, if you want to follow my github repo is &quot;ZeroMQTutorial&quot;. Now change directories into the ZeroMQTutorial directory and run the following commands:
we need axios-&gt;
npm install axios

Second we need to install ZeroMQ (we are using version 5 as of 20/July/2021) 
Note This command may take a bit of time -&gt;

You might have noticed that light/dark mode toggles are everywhere right now - pretty much every popular website allows users to choose which theme they prefer. So how do you add a theme toggle to your Svelte app?
Luckily, its pretty easy - here&#x27;s what you need to do:
Create a new component, DarkModeToggle.svelte, and add a new checkbox inside it:


Checkboxes are pretty good choices for toggles like this one because they are widely supported and represent Boolean states. In our case, false represents &quot;light off&quot; (&#x3D; &quot;dark&quot;), while true represents &quot;on&quot;.  
Append the new component to your app.

However, there are many ways to test, and the scenario and the application is usually what determines what the best approach is.

Stark



This tool provides a wide array of color and contrast checking abilities along with simulators to test you design again visual disabilities.

Stark has plugins to go in various design tools, but also in chrome.

Deque&#x27;s Dev tools AXE extension



There are extensions/add-ons for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. 
Additionally, Lighthouse accessibility checks are powered by AXE Core as well.


WAVE



WAVE is powered by WebAim and functions similarly to Deque&#x27;s AXE extensions.
An interesting element of WAVE&#x27;s functionality is that it give an accessibility markup over the entire site. 





  
  
  ANDI - Accessibility Testing Tool



ANDI (Accessible Name &amp; Description Inspector) is a free accessibility testing tool.


ANDI allows you to inspect your page on the basis of accessible names which come in handy especially if you&#x27;re working with interactive elements.

VS Code AXE Accessibility Linter



Checks React (.js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx), Vue (.vue), HTML (.html, .htm), and Markdown (.md, .markdown) files so you can avoid common accessibility defects. Angular (HTML) is not currently supported.

There several different plugin depending on what framework/ tech stack you&#x27;re working with.


I work a lot in React so my team frequently uses this plugin:

                    <span>Most of my professional career has revolved around JavaScript, but as a programming language enthusiast, I particularly enjoy learning about new languages. After playing a bit with Go, there were a few constructs that I felt would be useful in JavaScript as well. Here are two such constructs and some libraries I&#x27;ve implemented to bring them into JavaScript.
Love it or hate it, Golang&#x27;s approach to error handling is simple and straightforward.
result, err :&#x3D; someFunc();
if err !&#x3D; nil {
  // Handle error
}
// Do something with &#x60;result&#x60;

A place within JavaScript code where this style could particularly shine, is in regards to asynchronous code, where most of the times the following code is written to handle potential errors:

Don&#x27;t worry. Interview processes are a science for themselves. There are so many &quot;techniques&quot; interviewers try to use to determine whether you are the perfect or at least the right person for the job that you cannot learn them all in a lifetime. At least not as long as you don&#x27;t work in HR.

                    <span>Laravel 8 introduced new class based model factories and if you have an existing project you can use the legacy factories package to keep using the old factories. I have tended to keep the factories as they were and continue development, but after working on a fresh Laravel 8 project and using the new class based syntax I decided to go back and update the factories in the older Laravel apps. This article explains how I went about refactoring the factories to classes.
In this scenario we have a Laravel app that allows you to create a post. The post has a title, content, author and is either published or not published.

                    <span>The wars of the future will be fought with software and system architecture, as much as any other weapon. That’s why the US armed forces needed to start applying modern software methodologies at scale. 
The beginning of this incredible digital transformation began in 2017 when the US Air Force started a project called Kessel Run. Leading the project then, and now Chief of Platform of over 400 Kessel Run developers, is Adam Furtado.
Translating engineering to executives is a regular challenge for many of us, but I can almost guarantee translating engineering to military officials is way harder. When he’s not explaining why DevOps matters to his higher ups, Adam spends his time scaling Kessel Run operations by building systems of systems. This week’s episode of Dev Interrupted chronicles everything Adam has learned during his journey from 5 developers to over 400.

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
