        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this article, we will discuss a feature in DOCTOR-Y to predict the current patients' medical conditions based on their regular medications, using a dataset containing medicines and their corresponding medical conditions.

And this is done using searching techniques provided from the MongoDB. 
If you don't know what is DOCTOR-Y check this post.
Our goal is to generate a chart that shows the patients' conditions in a form of percentages, which are calculated based on all the medications they have taken during a specific period.
A patient that is prescribed with 3 medicines:
Actemra
Duexis
Indocin
The results should be something like this:

The dataset consists of 1224 records; each record contains the drug name, its corresponding condition, and the weight of this condition. It is derived …]]></summary>

Aya Bouchiha,
global attributes: are Html attributes that can be used on any HTML elements, like title and hidden.
accesskey: this attribute lets you specify a keyboard shortcut to focus an element.
The way to activate the accesskey depends on the browser and its platform
Code example:
<div>
  <h2>Lorem</h2>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing </p>
  <a accesskey="a" href="product/10">more details!</a>  
</div>

dir: lets you specify the text's direction.
Code example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
  </head>

First of all, this tutorial became far longer than I initially intended, so I decided to include this quick summary of the article:
There are various tools and SDKs for Teams app develpment so you need to pick the right & prefered tools!
TeamsFx is a great tool when you build app that uses Microsoft Graph API for fetching data, such as basic user info
TeamsFx handles the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow, getting an access token, and use the token to make Graph API calls
Use the Graph wrapper, client.api(path).get to make the call
Now, proceed to the main content!

The steps to support Graceful Shutdown in Go consist of two steps:
Listen for OS signals, and
Handle those signals.
In Go those signals are provided by the os/signal package. Starting with Go 1.16 the way I like to implement Graceful Shutdown is by using os/signal.NotifyContext, this function provides an idiomatic way to propagate cancellation when using goroutines, which is usually the case when dealing with long-term running processes.

Esperava pelo "não" e estava tudo bem, visto que a minha intenção na época era entender mais sobre os processos seletivos e criar expêriencia em entrevistas.
