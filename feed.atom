Question: 
We have a 9 line function that goes three indentations deep.
We can simplify this function. The question is, how much more readable are we able to make this function?
Through six simple iterations of refactoring this function we are going to simplify this hasUSNumber function into a single line with zero indents.
1: Traditional if-else statement (with nested if)
let hasUSNumber = dude => {
   if (dude.phone.exists === true) {
      if (dude.phone.number.startsWith('+1')) {
        return true

   } else {

2: Inverse if-else condition to remove nested if

A tree is a nonlinear data structure unlike Stack, Queue, Array, and Linked List, It is a collection of nodes connected with edges
Root: parent node is the first (top) node of the tree.
Parent: node has children
Child: node has a parent 
Siblings: nodes have the same parent
Leaves: last nodes of the tree
Depth: length of edges from a node to the root
Height: length of the longest path from a node to a leaf
Edge: link two nodes

In March 2021, no code pioneer Zapier acquired no-code community Makerpad. In April 2021, UiPath, a provider of low code automation software, IPO'd at $31 billion. Gartner predicts that by 2024, more than 65% of application development activity will come from low code application development platforms.
Software is eating the world, but low code and no code are making developers rethink how software is made.
Of course, (some) developers tell a different story. According to an Evans Data report, one in five developers never use low code, and almost three-quarters of developers use low code less than half the time. And anecdotally, many developers express a similar sentiment to low code a…]]></summary>

Since the advent of Single Page Applications the requirements for hosting have been reduced to a minimum. Anything that can serve a static HTML file will do the job just fine and the browser, bombarded with Javascript, does the heavy lifting.

I wanted to be sure I would not get a random bill for thousands of dollars from Google, so if you're trying to create a React app and want to have a free mapping service, look no further than React-Leaflet! It's an easy way to display a map in a React Component and render it with whatever information you want to use from your Redux state. This post will give you step by step instruction on implementing React-Leaflet. These instructions assume you are comfortable with Javascript, React, and Redux concepts and also assumes you have set up your application through

With Metasploit, the pen testing team can use ready-made or custom code and introduce it into a network to probe for weak spots. As another flavour of threat hunting, once flaws are identified and documented, the information can be used to address systemic weaknesses and prioritize solutions.

Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
