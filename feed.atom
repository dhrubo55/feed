In case you are just meeting it for the first time, grapQL is a runtime and query language that we can use to describe a format for our data and how to get that data. GraphQL is not tied to any specific programming language or database and as such it can be used with any database or language of your choosing so you don't need to learn anything from scratch.

In programming, it's important to make sure that your code is readable, maintainable, extendable and easily testable. One of the ways that we can improve all of these factors in our code is by using interfaces.
This article is aimed at developers who have a basic understanding of OOP (object oriented programming) concepts and using inheritance in PHP. If you know how to use inheritance in your PHP code, this article should hopefully be understandable.
In basic terms, interfaces are just descriptions of what a class should do. They can be used to ensure that any class implementing the interface will include each public method that is defined inside it.
Interfaces can be:
Used to define public methods for a class.
Used to define constants for a class.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Gatsby page development, when you hit a page that doesn't exist, you encounter a screen similar to the one below.

If you created a custom 404 page, for example in src/pages/404.js, you can click the Preview custom 404 page to display it. Entering the /404 route will do the job as well.
In production, however, the 404 page doesn't get handled by itself unless you use a dedicated hosting service for Gatsby pages. That's because Gatsby's development server is no longer present. The production bundle is just a bunch of static files. Making use of a web server (like nginx) to serve the production page forces you to configure the error pages yourself.
Disclaimer: the following nginx configuration is pretty basic, don't use it in production.
Let's assume your blog is hosted on the personalblog.com domain and is served from the /var/www/blog directory on port 80.
server {
        listen 80;
        root /var/www/blog;
        server_name personalblog.com www.personalblog.com;
        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}

After entering a route that doesn't exist in your production Gatsby site, nginx displays its default 404 error page.

Adding the error_page 404 /404; line makes nginx redirect to the /404 route in case of a 404 error. Your custom Gatsby 404 page will be displayed.
server {
        listen 80;
        root /var/www/blog;
        server_name personalblog.com www.personalblog.com;
        error_page 404 /404;
        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}

There is even a field of programming called creative coding where the goal is not to create something functional but rather expressive.
Even though programming for art has been a thing for a while, it used to be fairly inaccessible as it required deep knowledge in the field. Take Demoscene, for example. Demoscene is a computer art subculture that has been around since the 1980s. It involves creating audiovisual presentations, called demos, that are not only artistic creations but also technical achievements.

In a complex web application, with several components needing data, odds are that redundant API calls will be made. You may imagine even a simple e-commerce page: the user could want to see an article, then a second one, and then go back to the first. In such a case it's a sure bet that the app would redo its previous API calls, to essentially get the very same information it already had. Caching by the browser may help, for sure, but that also depends on the remote server providing the appropriate headers, and that may not always happen. So, we want to do something in our code that will complement whatever caching is done by the browser, if any, but ensure the best performance for the user in any case.

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
