                    <span>A REST API is an architectural pattern for creating web services. REST is a set of rules that outlines the best practices for sharing data between clients and servers. They use HTTP requests to manipulate data and communicate with web services. REST APIs are stateless, cacheable, and consistent. They&#x27;re great for building general-purpose and scalable web applications. The three major Python frameworks are Django, Flask, and FastAPI. 
Today, we&#x27;re going to explore FastAPI, an open-source web framework used to build APIs with Python. 
Let&#x27;s get started!
We&#x27;ll cover:

Flask vs FastAPI

I have even been told that if I know so much why don&#x27;t I write a post instead of taking cheap shots from the sidelines - which is fair enough really. The problem is that the subject can get very complicated if you want to understand it deeply. 
So here is my attempt to explain it. I will explain what I consider the core concepts in 2 levels of difficulty: simply, and more complicated. I should also warn you the journey is long ...

So I will break it up as much as possible. The first part will try to explain what asynchronous programming is.

                    <span>Most of us build our web projects with components. It makes our code more reusable, more maintainable, more testable, and easier to understand and debug.
We often share a few of these components, to be able to use them across projects. A &quot;design system&quot; for the UI, and some sort of a &quot;toolbox&quot; with util functions, for our logic.
Why, then, do we stop there? Why not share and collaborate on everything?¬†
Truth is, it&#x27;s not that easy to share and collaborate on components. You can group components together in the same repository and publish them as a single package, but then, you&#x27;re not really &quot;collaborating on components&quot;, you&#x27;re collaborating on a project.
What you really need is a way to develop, share and modify individual components from any project. Why? Because being able to pick and c‚Ä¶</span>

Static variables are tied to the Class itself. Each object of a class shares the static variable. 
Non-static variable (instance variables) are tied to the object. In the example below, every object of the Cat class has its own name variable. However, every object shares the catCount variable. 
When you see the static keyword in front of a variable name think of a shared variable.
Class Cat 
{
String name; // Non-static variable (each object has it&#x27;s own copy) 
static int catCount; //Static variable (each object of the class Cat shares this variable

Cat(String name){
this.name &#x3D; name; // Non-static variables can be referenced with &quot;this&quot; keyword

export default class extends Controller {

I&#x27;m a Rubyist and unashamedly rather lazy; so having that import statement at the top of every Stimulus controller always irked me. If you&#x27;re using Webpack, there&#x27;s a super simple way of circumventing this annoying import statement.  
First thing you need to do is create a file called application_controller.js and place it in your controllers directory. This is good practice nevertheless as you can put app specific utilities in there;‚Ä¶</span>

LoginID Dashboard in order to correctly configure the Server SDK.
Once logged into the dashboard, navigate to the Applications tab in the sidebar, select ‚ÄúAdd Application,‚Äù and select Management.
In the resulting form, you must create a name for your application and provide an API credential to be associated with this application. If you have already created an application, we suggest using the naming convention of ‚Äú{my-app) server.‚Äù
When adding the API credential, you can either upload your own public key, or have us generate a key pair on your behalf.
NOTE: All API calls made from a Management integration type require an API Service Token
Add SDK to Existing Application
pip install -e .

Create an SDK Instance

NOTE: If using a custom base_url, you can initialize the SDK with that base_url. Otherwise, it will default to the main LoginID production environment.</span>
