And why spend so much time developing a portfolio at all?      After all, you just need to create a small one-page website and add all the information about yourself and your works there. And here I definitely agree with you that if you are developing a business card website, then this is quite a working option. You don&#x27;t even have to spend a few days developing such a site. Such a site can be developed in 4-6 hours.
But I set myself a different task. I wanted to create a portfolio that would show with its appearance what kind of developer I am and what I am capable of. I wanted to use animations, build complex objects using HTML and CSS, make smooth transitions between pages, choose bright colors for the site.  But at the same time, of course, I di‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>This post is for the people who are interested in React Native because they have experience with React JS. People who know that being able to develop for mobile and web helps their job prospects but who also want to know how easy it&#x27;s going to be before they sink in too much time wading through the documentation (which is actually really good, you should check it out).
Getting React Native set up is incredibly easy, so definitely don&#x27;t let that stop you. In less than five minutes you can be building out an app that you can see displayed on your own phone. 

We&#x27;ll be using Expo CLI to get rolling quickly (more on the differences between the two here and the limitations of using Expo here). As long as you&#x27;re on Node 12+, you can install using npm, and create a new project.

View career paths as fluid
Focus on stretching yourself
Leverage your network

                    <span>Laravel framework comes with lots of awesome features, the outstanding one for me is the model  observers.
According to the Laravel framework‚Äôs documentation:
If you are listening for many events on a given model, you may use observers to group all of your listeners into a single class. Observers classes have method names which reflect the Eloquent events you wish to listen for. Each of these methods receives the model as their only argument. The  make:observer  Artisan command is the easiest way to create a new observer class.
The observers helps me to declutter my controller of clean-up codes that I might have to run before or after making a model event, and also gives me a way to plug into the model‚Äôs event‚Äôs lifecycle and run any logic I might see fit.

First of all, spin up your Strapi environment with the command in the terminal from the directory that houses Strapi:
$ yarn develop

This will start the Strapi server so you can now navigate to http://localhost:1337/admin/, once you are there enter the login data for the admin user.

                    <span>Docker is an open-source software platform that helps you simplify the process of creating, managing, running, and distributing your applications. With Docker, you can package your application along with all its dependencies into a container. Containers allow your applications to be deployed easily and uniformly.
Today, we‚Äôll dive deeper into Docker and discuss containers, modules, key terms, and more.
We&#x27;ll cover:
What is Docker?
Docker vs Kubernetes

Docker is an open-source software that runs on Linux and Windows. With Docker, you can package your application and its dependencies together into containers. Docker allows you to separate your applications from your infrastructure.

                    <span>A regular expression is an object that describes a pattern of characters. Regular expressions are often abbreviated &quot;regex&quot; or &quot;regexp&quot;.
The JavaScript RegExp class represents regular expressions, and both strings and RegExp define methods that use regular expressions to perform powerful pattern matching and search-and-replace functions on the text.
In simpler terms, a regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.
A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.
A regular expression can be defined as:
var pattern &#x3D; new RegExp(pattern,attributes);
OR
var pattern &#x3D; /pattern/attributes;

Like any development work, automation also needs to be planned, designed, developed, maintained and extended over time. Your automation code or automation framework is an application which is testing your actual application. That‚Äôs why SOLID principles are highly recommend for your automation to make it easy to understand, use, maintain and extend over time. When SOLID principles are not applied, your automation might become fragile, hard to maintain and hard to extend very soon.
Even if you are using different programming language like C#, Python or automation tool like HP UFT/QTP for automation, you should definitely consider applying SOLID principles to make your automation tester life easy. Please note ‚Ä¶</span>

Quicksort is a type of  Divide and Conquer algorithm like merge sort, it works by choosing an element as a pivot from the giving array, and appending the greater elements to the selected pivot, and shifting the smaller elements before it.
The space complexity of quicksort is O(log n)



best-case
average case
worst-case




O(n log n)
O(n log n)
O(n^2) when the list is already sorted, or the pivot is min or max value of the giving list

Material UI is a set of react components built based on the Material Design guidelines of Google.
Material UI consists of many accessible and configurable UI widgets.
The components are self-supporting and only inject the styles they need to display, which could lead to performance enhancements in your application.
Material UI has an active set of maintainers and a strong community behind it. It currently has over 69k stars on GitHub, making it one of the most popular component libraries out there.
If you‚Äôre looking to build a beautiful, consistent, and light interface quickly without sacrificing accessibility and performance, the material design will help you achieve that.
