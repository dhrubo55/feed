Here is a simple guide on establishing a connection between your database(MySQL) and Laravel application.
This can be done either by a database manager eg phpMyAdmin or the Command Line Interface (CLI).
Database Manager(phpMyAdmin)



Command Line Interface(CLI)




CREATE DATABASE db_name;

P.S: You have to log in to MySQL before you can create a database via any of these methods.
Laravel default environment file .env contain some common configuration values that differ based on if your application runs locally or on a production server.
P.S: This configuration values are based on my local machine , 



Update the .env with the database name you want to connect to,as well as the other environment variables if they differ from the default.
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=test
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

__Hurray! üéâThe laravel application is now properly connected to the database.
Laravel migrations simply allows you to easily perform certain actions to the database without going to the database manager (eg. phpMyAdmin). They can also serve as a version control for your database. They create tables, columns as well as modify them etc.
Migrations are found in database/migrations directory.
user migration and it looks like this:

It can be executed to the database with the following command:
php artisan migrate

P.S : Refresh your database , it has been updated with users' table and its properties.

I wrote an article to explain more on migrations here. You can also visit the laravel documentation here.
You're all set to continue building!üòé

Have you been at that point where you finished setting up your database and realized you forgot to add a column üò® or you put in a wrong column and you have to remove it üò£? Are you like me that usually refreshes the entire database for minor changes ? That's poor programming practice and what would you do if it was a company's database?
Laravel migrations simply allows you to easily perform certain actions to the database without going to the database manager (eg. phpMyAdmin). They can also serve as a version control for your database. 
A default laravel migration file comes with a class definition containing both an up() and a down() method. The up() method is run when migration executes to apply changes to the database while the down() method is run to revert those changes.

Leetcode Problem #128 (Medium): Longest Consecutive Sequence






  
  
  Description:



(Jump to: Solution Idea || Code: JavaScript | Python | Java | C++)
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
Examples:




Example 1:





Input:
nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]


Output:
4


Explanation:
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.






Example 2:





Input:
nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]


Output:
9



Constraints:




0 <= nums.length <= 10^5

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
