          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

          "description": "Learning a new Node.js framework can be daunting given the speed at which the ecosystem moves these days. Also some of the information on learning new techniques with Node.js is outdated - for example the sheer number of Express tutorials you still find out there! Express is long overdue for a replacement, and Fastify fits right in!  One of the first things to consider when running a Node.js server is how to handle logging the right way. ExpressJS did not offer anything out of the box, forcing another bike shed to paint amongst your team.  Fastify on the other hand recognizes that this is a critical piece of running a server and provides sensible defaults - in the case of logging - the pino logger. Join me in this article where I walk through how to setup a Fastify Node.js logger the right…",

Since the function has another function in it, it would require at least two rounds of parameters for a higher order function to be fully resolved.\nYou can use higher order functions to create partially applied functions. A partially applied function is a function which is partially applied and not fully resolved i.e hasn’t received the complete number of arguments it requires (arity) to fully resolve.\nWith …",

For example, Ruby has sleep(1000) and Python has time.sleep(1) to \"pause\" operation for 1 second, but there is no direct correlate in Javascript.\nAsynchronous actions in Javascript can usually call upon one of these two functions. setTimeout allows us to wait a specified amount of time before inv…",
