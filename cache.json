          "description": "Overview\n\n\nIf you're in middle of learning JavaScript or you already completed various online tutorials, you may have came across closures and did not bother much after learning about it. Interestingly you can easily find tons of blogs on this platform explaining closures in depth, but why you should bother reading them? This blog attempts to answer that.\nIf you're watching one of the tutorials or you've enrolled in a boot camp that briefs JavaScript, they might have touched the concept of closure and there's a high chance you've came across a code like this.\nconst string = \"hello closure\";\nfunction print() {\n  console.log(string);\n}\n\nWhich outputs:\nhello closure\n\nAnd a lazy conclusion comes out of this example is that the function insides can get the variable from its parent scope and marking the end of story for closures.\nThis part of the blog is a bit sloppy, so bear with me a little.\nfunction closure() {\n  let counter = 0;\n  function onlyExecutesOnce() {\n    if(counter == 1) {\n      return;\n    }\n    counter += 1;\n    console.log(counter);\n  }\n\n  return onlyExecutesOnce;\n}\n\n\n/* testing the function */\nconst myFunction = closure();\nmyFunction();\nmyFunction();\nmyFunction();\n\nOutput:\n1\n\nAt first glance I didn't not bother much and to my eyes it looked plain and simple.\nSo, after thinking about my code a question dropped in my mind.\nWhy is it that myFunction() is sharing the same surrounding environment as onlyExecutesOnce()?\nattaching itself with the information from its surrounding of where it was declared. In this case onlyExecutesOnce() is also attached with information of its surrounding which is being passed to myFunction().\nSo closures, my fellow readers opens a lots of doors for doing crazy and cool stuff in JavaScript.",
