                    <span>A lot can happen when a Rails controller action gets called. This includes transactional emails getting queued up for delivery. To ensure our controller&#x27;s behavior stays consistent as our app evolves we can write RSpec tests.
Among other things these tests can ensure that transactional emails get queued for delivery at the appropriate times.
This post documents a couple different methods I&#x27;ve used for those tests.
ActionMailer::Base.deliveries


If you have your queue_adapter set to :inline, then a deliver_later will happen synchronously. So, the email will immediately end up in the deliveries box.

                    <span>hi, this is part 4 of the tree data structure we&#x27;ll explain binary search tree operations with their implementation such as insertion, and search.
Let&#x27;s say we want to insert 17 in this binary search tree.



        20
      /    \
    12      23
  /   \    /  \
7     15  21   35

Since 17  12, we will go the right.
17 &gt; 15 and the no more child in the right&#x27;s why we will go to the right and insert it.
so this binary search tree above will be like this:



        20
      /     \
    12       23
  /   \     /  \
7     15   21   35
        \
         17

We need to know that the inserted node will be always one of the binary search tree leaves.

                    <span>I reached a great milestone moment in this coding journey recently. 
For the past month and a half I&#x27;ve tried to buckle down on my routine and study habits. I know it&#x27;s repeated often (and with good reason) to make your own projects. Don&#x27;t only follow along in a tutorial. And I&#x27;ve been trying to stick to that. I&#x27;ve also started writing some of the code with pen and paper, hoping to have it be better ingrained.
But with coding being so different from most of the things I&#x27;ve done before, progress felt stagnant still. A little different from imposter syndrome, but I&#x27;d get frustrated and just wonder 
am I really ever going to be able to learn this coding stuff?
And then I remember, this feeling isn&#x27;t so different at all.

As usual, if you are a visual learner, or simply prefer to watch and listen instead of reading, here you have the video with the whole explanation and demo, which to be fair is much more complete than this post.

If you rather prefer reading, well... let&#x27;s just continue :)
So, Scale Set Agents in Azure Pipelines.
As the name says those are agents that you can install and run in Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets, or VMSS.
As such, they can be scaled horizontally automatically, to make your build faster, more elastic, and eventually more flexible.

As frontend design becomes increasingly important for the success of an application, the need to work with the best frontend framework has become more of a necessity.
Finding the best framework to solve specific problems within a project provides a better frontend design and user experience, helping brands and developers attract and keep more users.
For developers working in JavaScript, Vue has become a popular and well-established framework. However, different projects require different solutions, and finding an alternative to Vue can propel a project forward with increased speed, performance, and community.

GraphQL and REST essentially accomplish the same task, i.e., communicate with a server and retrieve data. Here are a few similarities between the two:
Both GraphQL and REST are based on the concept of a resource, and they specify IDs for those resources.
Both GraphQL and REST rely on frameworks and libraries to handle the tiny networking details.
Both can differentiate if an API request is intended to read data or write it.

                    <span>To get my hands dirty and continue learning a little more holistically I have been wanting to get started on a side project for a long time. What’s been holding me back so far is the sheer abundance of options - I feel like a little kid at the candy store. Torn somewhere between frantically running around and completely paralysed. 
During the bootcamp I participated in, we created our own web app with React, Node &amp; MongoDB and tested a little with Cypress. Deployment / Hosting was not part of the course. Now while these are probably solid options, these choices were made for me. Now I am wondering, if I am completely free to choose, how do I decide on the stack for a project? 
I get that this highly depends on the project’s requirements and personal preferences. But say I want to create a very basic portfolio page - think virtual business card, really nothing fancy as an MVP (else I will literally never even try this). 
I discussed this with colleagues and got pretty diverse (and sometimes confusing) answers. This these perspectives helped me a lot put my own research into perspective, I would love to hear from you: 
How would you choose what to work with?
Based on what you would like to learn or rather something you already know well? 
How do you determine what tech stack is best suited for what you want to do?
Do you rather try something new and shiny or do you have a ‘winning team’ you aren’t likely to change any time soon?
Literally any tip, opinion or resource is highly appreciated :) Thanks so much!</span>

Stress on the keyword &quot;all&quot;. A very important thing is that if your aim is to become, say a frontend developer (a complete guide on it here), you don&#x27;t want to spend month after month on only JavaScript preparation.
The ideal mix that worked for me is to learn &quot;just enough&quot; to move on to React. This absolutely does not mean that you have learned JavaScript. This only means that you don&#x27;t need to. JavaScript, like any programming language, can be vast, especially with all the tooling a…</span>

Let&#x27;s start off with the simplest yet quite powerful functions of functools module. These are caching functions (and also decorators) - lru_cache, cache and cached_property. First of them - lru_cache provides least recently used cache of function results or in other words - memoization of results:

                    <span>For the Jasonette project. I created a simple Dockerfile and a Makefile with some commands to help building Android APK both in release and debug mode. 
It includes everything you would need like Gradle, JVM and Android SDK.
Additionally it includes Windows cmd files as an alternative to the Makefiles.

        docker
      
    
These are a bunch of scripts and docker files that will help you
developing apps with Jasonette in Android.

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
