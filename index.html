                    <span>What is Azure Private Link Service?


Azure Private Link service is the reference to your own service that is powered by Azure Private Link. Your service that is running behind Azure Standard Load Balancer can be enabled for Private Link access so that consumers to your service can access it privately from their own VNets. Your customers can create a private endpoint inside their VNet and map it to this service.
In todays tutorial we will look into an interesting use case for this service, in how we can connect an external source to consume an API management service (internal VNET mode) from an external non-peered VNET. As depicted in the following diagram:

Note: The source or entry point where we will place our private endpoint can be in a network that is in a completely different region‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>#First of all let me tell you what is a Rest and GraphQL !
-&gt; ##REST(Representational State Transfer) and GraphQL are two API design styles that serve the same purpose: transferring data over internet protocols including HTTP. ... However, REST is an architectural pattern, whereas GraphQL is a query language
1) Rest has Multiple End points, where as GraphQL has one endpoint !

2) Both generally give the Data back in JSON format

3) Both are Stateless: 
4) Rest APIs are more flexible, whereas GraphQL only works with POST !

5) In GraphQL you can be more detailed about the kind of data you want to fetch, but thing is not applicable in REST APIs as it fetches all the data available

6) In REST because of its tendency to pull all the data it brings a huge amount of data which is unnecessary to the client !
In total in my opinion both have their own benefits, if you are new to APIs, then go with REST APIs</span>

                    <span>This is the topic that sounds scary on listening but once you understand the internal meaning, its as easy as an ice cake.
In simple words, its a fancy way of saying &#x27;overloading () operator&#x27; as Functors or simply &#x27;using objects as functions&#x27; . If you don&#x27;t know what operator overloading is, don&#x27;t worry we will go through it. If you already know what operator overloading is, skip to Functors .
Just like you add two numbers you can add 2 objects using this concept. It is simply overloading a operator to work with our user defined objects rather than just predefined objects.
int a&#x3D;5,b&#x3D;3,c&#x3D;a+b;
myObject objA(10);
myObject objB(20);
myObject objC&#x3D;objA+objB;

Here as you add 2 integers to c, you are adding 2 object values and storing it in ObjC. If you directly compile the above code, that will‚Ä¶</span>

&quot;Exceptions should be rare. Throwing and catching exceptions is slow relative to other code flow patterns. Because of this, exceptions shouldn&#x27;t be used to control normal program flow.&quot;
Bom, de acordo com a documenta√ß√£o do framework, voc√™ deve evitar, ao m√°ximo, fazer o lan√ßamento de exce√ß√µes como:
throw new Exception(&quot;Throwing some random exception here&quot;);

Principalmente dentro dos hot code paths, que s√£o, basicamente, trechos (fluxos) da sua aplica√ß√£o que s√£o executados com muita frequ√™ncia, como por exemplo: valida√ß√µes.
Para exemplificar, vamos imaginar que voc√™ precise construir uma web api, que deve verificar cada requisi√ß√£o recebida e validar se a mesma atende ou n√£o √†s regras de neg√≥cio.
Exemplo: Ao receber uma requisi√ß√£o para cadastrar um novo usu√°ri‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Call For Papers (CFP ou C4P para os √≠ntimos) √© a documenta√ß√£o que deve ser submetida para uma confer√™ncia, um evento ou at√© mesmo uma publica√ß√£o cient√≠fica. Muitas vezes √© o maior obst√°culo para quem quer come√ßar a palestrar, porque n√£o basta enviar para a comiss√£o organizadora, seu C4P precisa se destacar dentre os demais e ser escolhido.
Aqui, mais importante do que saber quem √© voc√™ √© saber se voc√™ tem background para falar do assunto que voc√™ se prop√µe.  Tenha em mente que voc√™ n√£o precisa ser especialista, mas um frontend falando de constru√ß√£o de banco de dados faz tanto sentido quanto um neurocirurgi√£o falando de problemas √≥sseos no joelho.
Pode ser marqueteiro aqui. Voc√™ tem pouco mais de 50 caracteres para tentar chamar a aten√ß√£o das pessoas do evento, mas n√£o fuja do assunto: ele precisa dizer de forma clara o assunto que voc√™ vai abordar.
Sabe quando voc√™ l√™ a sinopse de um livro ou de um filme e ela te atrai tanto que voc√™ s√≥ consegue parar de pensar nisso? O seu resumo aqui tem essa fun√ß√£o. √â aqui que a sua palestra ir√° se destacar. Seu resumo deve ser breve (tente se limitar a dois tweets, algo em torno de 550 caracteres), e mais que isso: deve fazer com que a comiss√£o pelo menos queira ler o seu outline.
Aqui √© o momento de colocar em pr√°tica o que voc√™ aprendeu nas aulas de reda√ß√£o do ensino m√©dio. Tente estruturar seu outline como se ele fosse uma disserta√ß√£o: introdu√ß√£o, desenvolvimento e conclus√£o. 
Nem todo evento possui a mesma estrutura, portanto, leia com aten√ß√£o o que eles pedem na submiss√£o. Tente tamb√©m pedir ajuda a um amigo ou mentor, opini√µes externas sempre ajudam. 
Este √© o primeiro de uma s√©rie de textos onde irei organizar e compartilhar conte√∫dos que n√£o s√£o usuais, mas ainda assim, importantes.</span>

                    <span>In the last post I started a basic crud using tide and we end up with a simple api that allow us to store dinosaurs information.
Starting from there, let&#x27;s clean the code a little bit to be more organized. First, we had a closure in every route (let&#x27;s call it endpoint from here) and will be more clear if we extract that to functions.
async fn dinos_create(mut req: Request) -&gt; tide::Result {
    let dino: Dino &#x3D; req.body_json().await?;
    // let get a mut ref of our store ( hashMap )
    let mut dinos &#x3D; req.state().dinos.write().await;
    dinos.insert(String::from(&amp;dino.name), dino.clone());
    let mut res &#x3D; Response::new(201);
    res.set_body(Body::from_json(&amp;dino)?);
    Ok(res)
}

                    <span>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment, that allows you to write JavaScript on the server which is on of the most helpful advantages of Node.js since the same programming language can be used for server-side and client-side applications. It also runs on V8 JavaScript engine which makes it highly performant.
And one of the most popular frameworks for NodeJs is our subject today in this blog: Express Express is written on top of node.js to make writing server-side javascript easier.
So what we are going to do today is building a very basic REST API. 
Before we start, make sure that you have these if you don&#x27;t please install them.

You&#x27;ve always heard the same VS Code hacks over and over again like &quot;install Prettier extension to format your code&quot;, &quot;press alt + shift + down key to duplicate code&quot;, etc. In this article, I&#x27;ll share some VS Code hacks which I don&#x27;t usually see being shared around. You owe me a like if this article helps you.
Isn&#x27;t it annoying when you&#x27;ve got file A opened and you want to open file B but when you click file B, file B does open but file A closes? You might double click file B to open in a new tab but does it disappoint you sometimes like it did to me? To overcome this problem, search for &quot;workbench.editor.enablePreview&quot; in your settings and uncheck the option. From now onwards, VS Code will always open files in a new tab.

                    <span>With the high adoption of the Go language by developers and large companies, this has led companies to search for engineers with experience in Go.
This can create a lot of pressure of what to study to become a better engineer, this is very personal, it requires planning of what and when to study other subjects (even outside the engineering area).
In this blogpost some topics (with repositories and links) that I think are important to know in order to become an engineer person with even better Go knowledge, follow good practices for writing code, concepts of code structure (usually using design pattern), scalable code and clean code.
I can&#x27;t list only one link (repository) for this topic, I would recommend you to read for these 3 links and bring to your team&#x27;s day to day life what best fits‚Ä¶</span>

Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
