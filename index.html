  Key Concepts


I don&#x27;t intend to leave behind the many developers that are just getting started. So, here&#x27;s the general breakdown that you HAVE TO know.
Container is just as it sounds, a box to separate out resources used by it. This is somewhere between running apps directly in your host vs running in a VM (Virtual Machine). In a VM only the hardware resources are shared. However, in docker the OS kernel is shared. This does mean that the security of your container can be compromised if you let it (That&#x27;s a whole another beast of its own, so I&#x27;ll leave that out. Yes, this does mean you should not just pull down some random image and run exactly as the writer tells you to 😭…</span>

                    <span>Symbl.ai, a conversation intelligence platform for developers to create new experiences around conversation data, empowers developers to extend beyond mere automated speech recognition to contextual insights. Contextual insights are the results of Symbl.ai&#x27;s Natural Language Processing algorithms to recognize speaker intentions. Among a few of the most common intentions speakers express in speech are follow-ups, questions or action items. 
In short, action-items as a conversational entity recognized by Symbl.ai&#x27;s platform are a reflection of a speaker&#x27;s call to action during his or her conversation at any time. 
The first step to access action items as Symbl.ai&#x27;s contextual insights is to sign up. Register for an account at Symbl.ai (i.e., platform.symbl.ai). Grab both your appId and your …</span>

A billion years ago, Microsoft was trying to push a web development model that simulated Windows Forms development: ASP.Net Web Forms. It featured several ideas:
component based design (input fields were a component, you could bundle two together into another component, the page was a component, etc)
each component was rendering itself
components were defined using both HTML-like language, Javascript, CSS and server .Net code bundled together, sometimes in the same file
the rendering of the component was done on the server side and pushed to the client
data changes or queries came from the client to the server via event messages
partial rendering was possible using UpdatePanels, which were a wrapper over ajax calls t…</span>

                    <span>This tutorial explains how to create a language system and be able to change the language in the menu with the corresponding translations.
I will try to be clear and concise 😃
First, you need to create a controller App/Http/Controllers to record the language in session and be able to retrieve it with the middleware we will create just after :
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App;
use Illuminate\Http\RedirectResponse;

class LocalizationController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * @param $locale
     * @return RedirectResponse
     */
    public function index($locale)
    {
        App::setLocale($locale);
        session()-&gt;put(&#x27;locale&#x27;, $locale);
        return redirect()-&gt;back();

In my current job, we faced calculation errors when operating with float for Money.

Our first approach was to find every usage of money attributes and parse them with BigDecimal.

This solution has some drawbacks. First, we would need to replace it in many places. Second, it doesn&#x27;t prevent future developers to use float.  
In order to overcome those issues, I wanted to enforce a validation over every money attribute. 
money_attr &#x3D; 233.0 (float) we could detect that error and report it.
float-&gt;BigDecimal) rather than raising an error.
So I&#x27;d like to write Ruby code to say: &quot;hey if someone tries to assign a float to a money attribute then convert it to BigDecimal&quot;
In order to do that I came up with this solution:

Continuing on from my previous blog about website security week, we&#x27;re going to talk about a Referrers on the web.
Referrers on the web allow sites you are visiting to see what site you have come from, as the Referer header (it is actually mispelled in the HTTP Specification) contains a absolute or partial url of the site you&#x27;ve come from if you have followed a link.
commonly used for tracking and analytics, but it can also be used to steal information for example that contained in the URL of a reset password page or where a token is part of the URL, which is why it comes under security headers.

                    <span>Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to a graphical interface, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that data. A person who does this is called a front-end developer.
Being a frontend developer, you do one of the most important tasks for your company. To become a expert in it, it takes a lot of tasks and efforts. 
Here are some projects that you can do to master frontend development- 
1.Design and code your own portfolio website.
It is the only place, where you can show your skills, personality &amp; your work. This needs to be different. If you don&#x27;t know anything about designing a website, make sure to take help from Dribbble, they are amazing thousands of designers around the world are posting their design there you can take inspirations from  there and put your 100% effort in coding the websites.
2.Make a beautiful open-source project
Take Hard designs from Dribbble as a project, and try your best to copy it by coding it. This could make your GitHub-profile a lot more strong as well as can make your skills better.

                    <span>Because of React’s ubiquity (169k stars on GitHub), developers have a near-endless supply of UI libraries with custom components to draw upon to build applications. But not all React component libraries are created equal. Some are best for general purposes, others were created specifically for web development, and many are tailored for niche use cases like enterprise product production.
We’ll review React component libraries in this post considering several factors like popularity, use cases, documentation, resources, support, etc.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
