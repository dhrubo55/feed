                    <span>The office of the 20th century is a testament to design. A great deal of thought goes into the layout of a building. How are the offices laid out? Where are the elevators located? Where will teams meet? But the focus on co-located office space is quickly becoming a relic of the past. To meet the challenges of the 21st century GitLab‚Äôs Head of Remote Darren Murph is pushing organizations to put just as much thought into their remote work structure as they would an office building.
For many companies, the transition to this mindset comes with difficulty. They‚Äôve shifted into remote work as a necessity, but maintain the 20th-century ‚Äòoffice-first‚Äô mindset. While this is passable and **can **work, it‚Äôs not ultimately taking advantage of the key benefits of a virtual atmosphere.

Her former employer ‚Äî Packet ‚Äî was acquired by Equinix, a huge company with more than 30,000 employees and over 200 locations around the world. Suddenly, the small team at Packet who were experts at remote work found themselves in the position of trying to onboard not just themselves at a new company, but onboard an organization of 30,000+ to the principles, structure, and best practices of a fully remote work environment. Because Equinix is the largest data center company in the world, operating data centers and office hubs all over the globe, the switch to remote work had to be as seamless and efficient as possible.

                    <span>Coding is hard. And there is so much to learn, no one person can really know it all. I think that&#x27;s why developers tend to rely on the developer community so much (more than other types of jobs I think). It&#x27;s why welcoming community hubs like dev.to have exploded.
In this post, I wanted to share three communities that offer the opportunity to learn from and connect with your fellow developers. They are communities that I participate in actively and have gained a lot from. Even when they cater to new or aspiring developers (as a couple of them tend to do), I&#x27;ve found amazing opportunities to learn, even as someone with decades of experience as a developer.

    Signaling is the way how one party (namely agent) dispatches the information about itself to another acting party (namely principal). In the job market, this can be seen as an attempt by the potential candidate to showcase their ability to the potential employer. For example, your bachelor&#x27;s degree (if you have one) is a form of signaling. It shows that for at least four years you worked hard, managed to pass the required class, and hopefully attained knowledge.





    Side projects or portfolio projects are also a form of signaling. They convey a message to the potential hiring managers that you can show initiative. You can take ownership of the project and work on it independently. It also demonstrates that you have a genuine i‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Hello everyone!
In this article we will learn how to sign JSON Web Token with RSA key.
Let‚Äôs start!
First of all, I&#x27;m gonna create the project folder. Then install jsonwebtoken package.
cd path/to/your/workspace
# Create project folder
mkdir jwt-rsa
# Change directory
cd jwt-rsa
npm init -y
# Install JWT
npm install --save jsonwebtoken

Now let&#x27;s generate public and private key. If you increase the key length, token length will be increase too. This means HTTP request body size will be increase. But also it depends what kind of payload we we&#x27;ll sign.
# Create a folder named keys
mkdir keys
# Minimum RSA key length is 1024 bits
# Maximum RSA key length is 16384 bits 
# Don&#x27;t add passphrase
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 1024 -m PEM -f keys/rsa.key
# Write public key to keys/rsa.key.pub file

Code can always work, but can you maintain it across the years?
This is the important part for me: maintain the development and release new features without rewriting it.
Those are simple tips, for best practices, in long term developments with distributed teams:
Always comment on your code, even if you think that you understand it. Because tomorrow you&#x27;re not available and some  colleague has to continue it.
Try to set a standard for variable names, don&#x27;t let your team use any names. Please, I beg yo‚Ä¶</span>
