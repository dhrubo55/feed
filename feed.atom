        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Setting up browser notifications are in every way crucial in web application development....

most times we do need to pass valuable informations to application users in order to decide our next step.
The process of implementing web notifications is made so easy with the browser notification api...
//first of all we check if the browser supports notification
if(!window.Notification){
console.log("browser notification not supported")
// now we try to display a notification
const showNotification = () =>{
const title =" hey there man, how's it going ";
const options = {
    body:" would you like to recieve weekly updates from us",
    icon:"./assets/logo.png"
}
const notify = new Notification(title,options)

//optionally you could decide to clear the notification dialog after some time

setTimeout(()=>{
//now we check the permission status
if (Notification.permission === "granted")
//this basically runs if the user neither accepted nor denied the request
else if (Notification.permission !== "denied"){
console.log('permission denied');
and thats all you need to start implementing browser notifications in your web application...
note: web notifications only works on a secure https, something of this sort "file:///C:/Users/HILLARY/Notify.html" would not work]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Writing code, it's easy to make mistakes. A misspelled word on occasion, forgetting a closing tag in an HTML file, The smallest of mistakes can be hidden once the application becomes large enough. Recently, I found out about a plug-in called emmet that seems like it could possibly cut down on lines of code that I would've normally typed out manually, resulting in less mistakes. So far it seems like a plug-in that I will be making great use of in the future. 
One cool thing emmet allows you to do is seen when writing out tags. If you wanted a simple pair of div brackets normally you'd type them out.
<div></div>

Using emmet you simply type out the word div, press enter and the result would be the same. 

Another great thing about emmet is that if you wanted to give the element or a class you can do that as well.
div#blach

would give us
<div id='blah'>
<div> 

Once again, less typing less chance of an error on your part. You can even to the same with a class as well.
div.blach

would give us
<div class='blah'>
<div> 

If you're familiar with CSS you may notice similarities in how one would tell emmet we want an id or class vs a CSS declaration of an id or a class as well. As stated before, I'm in the early stages of purposefully using emmet, so I'm learning it all as I go. I wanted to share what I've learned and maybe point other beginners in the right direction. Finding cool things like this keeps me at my computer and excited for what I may find next. Happy Coding!]]></summary>

This is a bit of a short post for me to share my thoughts about JavaScript libraries in research.
I've been working on various research projects for the past few years in high school, ranging from inventing practical methods of reducing microplastic pollution to creating fully fledged JavaScript libraries and presenting at ISEF.
From this experience, I've found that many web/JavaScript related research projects are subpar -- in fact, the entire web development field is downright untapped. Most research projects are unfinished, outdated, and so unpractical it has no use in real life.
Web development needs a lot of improvement in the research space. This allows other researchers to gain insight into new technologies -- in my case, JavaScript libraries. We need more representation to explore more interesting topics, like WASM, compiler-based frameworks, and worker-based libraries.
So... what should you take away from this? Well, if you have a substantial, practical, and useful library in the web development space, develop a research project in parallel to contribute to the great world of science.]]></summary>

These libraries are used to simplify and handle the complexity of dates and times in JavaScript. There are many advantages to using these JavaScript libraries which include the fact that they can help you with parsing, formatting, and setting a wide variety of date/time formats.
The most popular JavaScript library for handling date and time is Moment.js. Other libraries for handling date/time include:
-date-fns - this library provides you with a large amount of functions for working with dates
-moment - this library has been deprecated but it still remains one of the most popular
-datejs - this library provides you with a simple interface to work with dates
‚Äî
Dates and times are essential in a variety of fields. JavaScript has a lot of libraries to help programmers handle these two concepts better.
The JSS date library is the most popular one used for date handling. It is open-source and provides a lot of options for developers who need it. The library provides methods for parsing, formatting, manipulating, and generating dates, as well as handling time zones and calendars.
This JSS library can be used with other JavaScript frameworks like Angular, React or Vue just by including the library with the respective framework package manager (NPM or Yarn).]]></summary>

  Show users what they want (even though they don‚Äôt even know what they want)



Personalized content proposals are now an established element of the Web. Most social media serve content to their users based on multiple touchpoints of the user‚Äôs interaction with the platform. (Some of them also track the user outside their pages, which has caused a whole discussion about privacy and blocking cross-domain tracking.) Usually, the aim is to increase some interaction rate (i.e. measured by the number of visits, purchases or other actions per user).

Online shops increase their revenue with clever recommendations of products that appear at every stage of the sales funnel. But non-retail sites can also benefit from the advantages of recommender systems. If you run a website that provides content, you can use content recommendations to maintain user attention and increase visits.

One of our primary goals at Daily is to help our customers embed reliable and easy-to-use video calls into their apps in the shortest developer time possible. One way we‚Äôve found to do this is by offering Daily Prebuilt. 
Daily Prebuilt is Daily's ready-to-use, embeddable video chat that can be added to any app with just a few lines of code. This is in comparison to our call object option, which enables customers to build their own custom video calls with our core APIs.

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<replace_with_channel_id>
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos üôÉ
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
