So let's go to some important points about it:
Did you get the task but didn't understood the description? So it's useless to ask the Dev next to you "hey, I don't know how to do handle this, can you help me?". Even if he/she explains, you won't understand because you didn't even understood what to do, or what kind of problem is happening.

Tomit allows to write portable scripts and execute them to satisfy users' needs. The same what ohmyzsh plugins do


Unlike ohmyzsh  plugins which are written on Zshell, Tomtit plugins could be written on similar Bash or many other languages supported by Sparrow ( on which the Tomtit is built on )

After learning about the exciting, but sadly only Stage 1 proposal for pattern-matching in JavaScript, I felt compelled to write a library that tries to, erm, match it as closely as I could:
import { match, when, otherwise } from 'match-iz'

match(haystack)(
  when(needle)(true),
  when(thread)(false),
  otherwise('bale')
)

Essentially, pattern-matching is if/then and switch/case with a little more declarative cowbell. 🐮 🔔
We can probe into an object:
const todosReducer = (state, action) =>
  match(action)(
    when({ type: 'set-vis-filter' })
      (({ visFilter }) => ({
        ...state,
        visFilter

    when({ type: 'add-todo' })
      (({ text }) => ({

Sometimes we want a particular program or task to execute repeatedly with different inputs each time. Here comes the role of a function that executes the processing logic with different input and output.
Now you have a basic understanding about function, let's discuss how to create a function.
"Declare a function" is just a rephrase of "Create a function"
You need three things to create a simple function:
function keyword
name of the function
statement or logic

A plugin will be used to save us HtmlWebpackPlugin! 
It will inject our output file directly in our HTML ! It will be very helpful when we will use a hash name (waiting for the next webpack academy to check this 😇) !
