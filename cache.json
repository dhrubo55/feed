You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.\nChanged: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention\nChanged: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)\nThank you @PiyushLosalka",

          "description": "Have you ever tried to merge a Pull Request and it seems to have a conflict on file that you changed intentionally?\nWhen it comes to conflict resolution, it can be a painful experience sometimes, even when you all you’re doing is accepting the incoming changes.\nGit can be intimidating sometimes, and most people tend to prefer a GUI to manage their versioning and source control. But sometimes using the CLI can be the better option.\nI’m the kind of weird that likes to do things on the CLI when possible, so I have a small life-hack that has saved me so much time during conflict resolution.\nIn this example we are going to imagine we are trying to make a PR from development to staging, once you’ve created the PR you notice there is a few conflicts and the PR can’t be merged right away. Don’t panic, we can fix this with the power of the CLI! \nMake sure you have the latest version of your destination branch (in this case staging) checked out on your local environment.\nGo to your source branch (in this case its development) and run: \ngit pull origin staging —strategy ours\nThis will accept the history of the source branch over the destination branch and resolve the conflicting files  for you. Now you can safely push the resolution to your remote and the PR you submitted should now be mergeable.\nThe CLI can be an intimidating place, but sometimes it can be the fastest way to achieve a task. Merge strategies are one of the most powerful options you can use from the git source control system, and there’s many more strategies that allow you to get even more flexibility from these options, I’ll leave a couple of links below where you can learn more about git merge strategies, thanks for reading!\nLinks: \nhttps://git-scm.com/docs/merge-strategies\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-strategy",

          "description": "Welcome to the first vue academy ! It will be a list of lot of article on vue! I have 2.5 years of experience in this and I can teach a few thing about this ! \nFor this course we will focus on scoped attribute in CSS.\n<style>\n    .toto {\n        color: blue;\n    }\n</style>\n\n<template>\n    <div class='toto'> Hi </div>\n</template>\n\nIt will work but your class can be used in any other component. So if you change toto class, it can impact other component style (side effect).\nIf you want to declare general class, you should create a properly file for this.\nThe solution to create a class that can be used by only one component is the attribute scoped in <style>.\n<style scoped>\n    .toto {\n        color: blue;\n    }\n</style>\n\nCSS will be applied to the elements of the current component only. This is similar to the style encapsulation found in Shadow DOM.\nWhen you will compile your code, the code above will be equal to\n<style>\n    .toto[data-v-f3f3eg9] {\n        color: blue;\n    }\n</style>\n\n<template>\n    <div class='toto' data-v-f3f3eg9> Hi </div>\n</template>\n\nAs you can see it's very simple & basic but very strong. Vue will inject an attribute on the scoped class and apply this attribute on each element that include the scoped class !.",

I just want to share with you why I decided to move to WebStorm and why I'm still using it and maybe you could consider using it too!.\nThe first reason why I decided to start using WebStorm is because I changed my computer, and as a developer with a lot of work I needed to start coding as fast as I could, so I downloaded VsCode because that was the editor which I used to use, then I realised that I did not have all my plugins that I had in my previous computer (obviously) and I did not even remember their names, it was very frustrating.

          "description": "In this blog, I’m going to talk about Containment, Specialization and Inheritance in React-Native/React, the difference between them and how you can use them to reuse your code.\nFirst, while the examples shown below are related to react-native, the theory is also applicable to react. The concepts might help you to go DRY. Let’s discuss these points one by one.\nWhen you wrap your component(s) within a higher-order component, it’s a containment. Some components don’t know their children ahead of time. Some common cases are Sidebar, Dialog. And for the sake of reusability, some components better be generic.\nThe following problem can make this clear:\nWe have a table of n rows and two columns. The columns can hold not just the text but any other JSX component (Button, Image, Icon) too. However,…",

The steps are almost the same for every popular distro.\nFirst of all you will need a pendrive. Without one we can't do so much... \nDownload a program to create bootable USB drive. There are many programs for that, here are some of them: UNetbootin, Rufus, Etcher, Linux Live USB Creator and there are many more.\nNot all of them are for all Operating Systems so you will need to check if they are available for your OS.
