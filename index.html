                    <span>I am currently a Flatiron student. Our first phase focused on the fundamentals of Javascript and understanding APIs. At the end of this phase, we have to synthesize our learnings into a one-page app that interests us and showcases our understanding. I want to share an overview of my project as well as the two parts of the project that I struggled with but ultimately learned the most from.
Before I get into my project, let’s break down what an API is. API stands for “Application Programming Interface” and is an intermediary between two applications so that they can communicate with each other. 
Companies (like Google) or organizations (like Governments) use API’s to share information or functionality with us so we can use the data to build projects. There are free API’s out there open to an…</span>

                    <span>Stuck writing large and nested if-else if-else conditions? Trouble following how all these different conditions interact and flow together? Here&#x27;s a tool that can help: decision trees.
Decision trees are a way to model conditional logic in a clear and composable way. Although commonly used in machine learning, they can be just as useful in more &quot;typical&quot; use cases which we will explore in this article.
This article will provide a brief introduction into trees as a data structure and decision trees as a tool, as well as their application in software development.
We will create a binary decision tree in JavaScript step-by-step and apply it to decide whether a value is a positive number, negative number, zero, or not a number at all.

                    <span>About a month ago, a friend and I came up with an idea for a small website and decided to create an MVP in a couple of days to give it a shot. The idea was pretty simple; a meme-driven chat room and a live price chart for each cryptocurrency. I was assigned to create the backend for the project, and my friend would make the web client.
I set three requirements for myself before starting to work on the server. First and foremost, I wanted to get the MVP out as soon as possible. Secondly, I wanted to make the server as lightweight as possible to just leave it running on a cheap VM. Lastly, I wanted to design the architecture to allow for easy scaling if the shit coin investors decide to make another stupid decision and use our application.
The first step was to think of the entire server as …</span>

Arrays or Lists are used to store data in memory Sequentially (In Order).
In JavaScript, Arrays are built-in Data Structures.
And there are Methods to Access, Push, Insert, and Delete Data.
Using Big O with these Methods will be:
- Access    &#x3D;&gt; O(1).
- Add       &#x3D;&gt; O(1).
- Insert    &#x3D;&gt; O(n).
- Delete    &#x3D;&gt; O(n).
- Searching &#x3D;&gt; O(n).

In the first part of this tutorial, we went over how to set up a MongoDB Realm app with sample data, generate the schema, create and restrict roles, and then integrated it with a React app, implementing an authentication system.
In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll go over how to ensure only logged-in users by email and password can add reviews, and we&#x27;ll test adding reviews by users that are not logged in to see MongoDB Realm Roles and data access rules in action.
You can find the code for this tutorial here.
We&#x27;ll start with the add reviews form. This form will be accessed through a link in the card of the restaurant that&#x27;s showing on the home page…</span>

We will be writing most of the things from scratch to see how things work under the hood but will be using react-spring to animate because it takes the animation out of React for performance reasons! don&#x27;t worry logic will be still ours, though you can surely remove react-spring out of the picture and use something else or just React ;) , we will see it at the end.

React is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.
In this blog, we will learn how to install React JS in Laravel 8. If you don&#x27;t know how to install Laravel 8 in React JS, this example tutorial is for you. I will show you step by step to install react js in your Laravel 8 application.
We will use the Laravel UI package to install React JS in the Laravel 8 application. I will show you React JS installation process with auth or without auth in Laravel 8. So let&#x27;s start our tutorial. So you will also see Laravel 8 React auth or Laravel 8 React authenticati…</span>

                    <span>It only takes three lines to use the elm-inspired AppRun architecture in React apps.
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
AppRun is an elm-inspired event-driven library.
Using AppRun and React in conjunction is one of the best ways to build a web app. In this post, I will explain why and how-to.
If you are new to AppRun, please visit the AppRun Docs for more information.
Let&#x27;s use the code from the React Hooks Doc as an example.
import React, { useState } from &#x27;react&#x27;;

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we&#x27;ll call &quot;count&quot;
  const [count, setCount] &#x3D; useState(0);

  return (
    
You clicked {count} times
 setCount(count + 1)}&gt;

Thinking that maybe some more people can go through the same simple stress, combining with the idea that knowledge does not occupy space and with the old desire that I have to write for you, I decided to write this short post that can help several people, just like me and use him as a pilot here in the medium.

If you want to see my whole config, I keep all my setup files on GitHub: https://github.com/unitehenry/config
Before we dive into my configuration, here are the tools I use that help me speed up my tasks as a developer:

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
