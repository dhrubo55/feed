          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

There's a lot to consider when it comes to security, JWTs, salting, and much more.\nFortunately, this can be accomplished instantly with the <Auth /> component (<NativeAuth /> for React Native) from the 'easybase-react' package.\nThe final result will look like this:\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <EasybaseProvider ebconfig={ebconfig}>\n      <Auth>\n        <h2>You're In!</h2>\n      </Auth>\n    </EasybaseProvider>\n  );\n}\n\n\nCreate a free account at easybase.io and make a Project. From there, download your ebconfig token and place it in your React project's src/ folder. Install the package with npm i easybase-react.\n\nImport this config file, along with EasybaseProvider and Auth:\nimport ebconfig from './ebconfig';\nimport { EasybaseProvider, Auth } from 'easybase-react';\n\nWrap your entire component in EasybaseProvider and place Auth inside of it. Children of Auth will only be loaded and displayed if a user is currently signed in.\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <EasybaseProvider ebconfig={ebconfig}>\n      <Auth>\n        <h2>You're In!</h2>\n      </Auth>\n    </EasybaseProvider>\n  );\n}\n\nRun your project and create an example account by clicking 'No Account? Sign Up':\n\nThis will sign you in! The <Auth /> component is highly customizable when it comes to CSS and forms, read here for customization.\nTo sign out, import useEasybase and call the signOut function:\nfunction User() {\n  const { signOut } = useEasybase()\n  return <button onClick={signOut}>Sign Out</button>\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <EasybaseProvider ebconfig={ebconfig}>\n      <Auth>\n        <User />\n      </Auth>\n    </EasybaseProvider>\n  );\n}\n\nAll users will appear in the Easybase interface, under the Users tab:\n\nFor a more in-depth reference, check out the full walkthrough here.",

This exercise also utilized mothereffinghsl to get the color gradiant hue for our drawn line working in conjunction with the event listeners.  \nGitHub\nLoved this overview. I learned a few things about DevTools that I did not know before as well as all the varieties of console. that can be used. I had mostly used console.log() and console.dir() before and was surprised at just how many there are and the variety of ways they can be used! I feel like I've been missing out not knowing about console.table()!!\nGitHub\n\nThis exercise worked with checkboxes and using the shift key to be able to select multiple checkboxes at a time. This was done by programmatically setting the boxes to checked with JavaScript until you click the last one. Until the last one clicked is selected, our flag variable gets set to false which makes this functionality work both when selecting from the bottom to the top top or vice versa, by setting the variable equal to this or to lastChecked.

See previous post \"Network Troubleshooting for the Well-Rounded Developer\"\nWhether you are a solo developer working directly with your clients, or a software engineer part of a larger team that's delivering a large feature or service, you need to do more than just shipping code. To succeed in your role, you also need good project management skills, regardless of whether there's an officially assigned \"project manager\". By upping your project management skills, you'll increase the odds of delivering consistently and on time — necessary for earning trust among your peers and stakeholders.

Um link interessante sobre isso aqui \nE um agradecimento final ao meu líder que conseguiu me explicar isso pacientemente e me ajudar a solucionar o problema. Obrigada, Felipe!",
