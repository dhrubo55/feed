          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

          "description": "There's a principle in programming called Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). The reason repeated code is a problem is because any change requires fixing code in multiple places. This usually means more work for programmers and more room for errors.\n\n\nNotice in the example below that the eat method is shared by Cat and Bear:\n\n\n\n\nfunction Cat(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\n\nCat.prototype = {\n  constructor: Cat,\n  eat: function() {\n    console.log(\"nom nom nom\");\n  }\n};\n\nfunction Bear(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\n\nBear.prototype = {\n  constructor: Bear,\n  eat: function() {\n    console.log(\"nom nom nom\");\n  }\n};\n\nThe eat method is repeated in two places.

          "description": "Just like people inherit genes from their parents, an object inherits its prototype directly from the constructor function that created it. For example, here the Dog constructor creates the beagle object:\n\n\n\n\nfunction Dog(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\n\nlet beagle = new Dog(\"Snoopy\");\n\nbeagle inherits its prototype from the Dog constructor function. You can show this relationship with the isPrototypeOf method:\n\n\n\n\nDog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle);\n\nThis would return true.\nAll objects in JavaScript (with a few exceptions) have a prototype. Also, an object’s prototype itself is an object.\n\n\n\n\nfunction Dog(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\n\ntypeof Dog.prototype; // yields object\n\nBecause a prototype is an object, a prototype can have its own prototype! In this case, the prototype of Bird.prototype is Object.prototype:\n\n\nHow is this useful? You may recall the hasOwnProperty method from a previous post:\n\n\n\n\nlet beagle = new Dog(\"Snoopy\");\nbeagle.hasOwnProperty(\"name\");\n\nThe hasOwnProperty method is defined in Object.prototype, which can be accessed by Dog.prototype, which can then be accessed by beagle. This is an example of the prototype chain. In this prototype chain, Dog is the supertype for beagle, while beagle is the subtype. Object is a supertype for both Dog and beagle. Object is a supertype for all objects in JavaScript. Therefore, any object can use the hasOwnProperty method.",

To understand the language in-depth, you first have to know what objects are and how they work.\nAn object is used to store key-value data.

A property is a \"key-value\" pair, where the key is the property name and value can be anything\nTo create an object, the curly braces {...} is used with a list of optional properties.
