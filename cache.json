Si, y más probable que te equivoques\ngit checkout es un comando que podemos usar para crear y borrar branches, navegar entre ellas y eliminar cambios que no están en estado de stage.\nAhora, la gente de git se despabiló y se dio cuenta de que sería mejor tener comandos más verbosos para las distintas acciones que hacemos con nuestro controlador de versiones.\nCada uno de los siguientes comandos que te voy a mostrar realizan la misma acción que hacíamos antes con git checkout pero escrito de una forma más amigable\nCuando queremos crear una rama, es normal que nos encontremos usando el comando git checkout mi-rama. Para hacerlo más entendible, lo vamos a cambiar por git branch mi-rama\nEs normal cambiar a una rama de un colega para revisar sus cambios o querer volver a develop para tener los últimos cambios. Yo siempre usé para esto git checkout rama-de-mi-colega. hasta que descubrí que existe un comando que es mucho más claro: git switch rama-de-mi-colega\nCuando ya separé cuales son los cambios que van en el commit, lo demás se descarta, y para descartar recurrimos al git checkout -- .. Hoy en día git te recomienda utilizar git restore .\nUtilizar el mismo comando para todo puede ser super practico, pero si recién estas empezando, puede que te provoque un par de USB (USB? ABC? ACV!). Nuestros comandos y nuestros procesos deben dejar claras nuestras intenciones, de esta manera podemos compartir un paso a paso y ser lo más claros posibles en nuestra comunicación técnica.\nFuentes:\ngit branch\ngit switch\ngit retore",

          "description": "Do...While loops\n\n\nDo while loops allow developers to repeat code execution as long as a condition is met. So whereas before we were instructing the code to run a number of times, or from beginning to end of an object. Now, we tailor it a little more and say only keep running this code \"until\" this condition is no longer valid. \ndo{\n   //Code goes here\n}\nwhile(condition)\n\nUnlike the For and Foreach loop, the code is executed a minimum time of once. As the do code is ran before the while check. \nExample :\n\nvar counter =0;\n\ndo {\n   Console.WriteLine(\"Keep Going\");\n   counter++;\n}\nwhile (counter < 10);\n\nHere the code will run once, check if counter is less than 10, if it is it will keep going. Once the counter is >=10 the loop will exit and no longer execute the do code. \nOk so the while loop works on a very similar concept to the do while, however rather than running the code first then checking. The check is done first. Meaning the code will only run whilst the condition is met. \nvar sum = 0;\nvar dartsThrown = 0;\nwhile(sum < 180 && dartsThrown <3)\n{\n  var dartScore = new Random.Next(61);\n  sum+= dartScore;\n}\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Your score is \" + sum);\n\nThere you go you've been introduced to the 4 ways of looping within C#. Each has there uses and are suited better for certain situations. \nAfter you've played around with them yourself , you'll see how easy they are to use, and which loop would suit your needs best.",

However in a Foreach loop it will go from the first item all the way through to end in sequence. Unless, you manipulate the sequence by skipping items using the continue keyword. \nThe foreach loop can iterate over any object that inherits from the IEnumerable class (e.g lists, collections). \nAs already mentioned, it does this in order of the list, i.e order the items were loaded in / added to the list (or ordered). It does this because it iterates over the instances of the list.
