                    <span>IP addresses are an essential part of computer networking. They play an important role in sending and receiving information on the internet. Every device that connects to an internet network has an IP address, which means there are billions of IP addresses that exist. Today, we’re going to discuss IP addresses, how they work, static IP vs dynamic IP, and more.
We&#x27;ll cover:
What is an IP address?
How does an IP address work?
Static IP addresses
Dynamic IP addresses
Static IP vs dynamic IP
Wrapping up and next steps





An Internet Protocol address, or IP address, is a unique identifier assigned to every device on a TCP/IP network. The Internet Protocol is the set of rules that outlines how data should be transported across the internet or local networks. IP addresses help identify devices …</span>

                    <span>JavaScript is a beautiful language, since it is loosely typed it is super easy to start coding with it. But to take full advantage of this powerful language one should always know the basics and what else is a better place to start than the execution context!
I am writing this article to help people who are beginners or at intermediate level, so I will try to explain everything in the simplest way possible. Let&#x27;s begin!
Execution context is a box that is created every time a javascript code is executed. The box is divided into two parts : &quot;memory creation&quot; and &quot;code execution&quot;.
Lets take a simple code to understand what goes inside these parts of execution context box.
1.  var x &#x3D; 5;

There are a million technologies. And you&#x27;re not expected to know them all, so ask! [I don&#x27;t understand what these words mean&quot; From what source can I read about this? Remember there are no dummy questions, only fools who don&#x27;t ask.
The IT world is full of hostile opinions and we all want the best results. That is not why you have to become an unpleasant and arrogant person. Radiate kindness. You&#x27;re going to go far.
Look for existing solutions before starting a task. Understand the coding paradigms used. Look at your team&#x27;s code. Present your solution in the best way.

If you missed the fun live, don&#x27;t worry- you can watch the replay here on YouTube, and in the embedded video below!




On this episode we cover:
5:20 Chloe tells us about an AI/ML talk she did this weekend where she mentioned Beep Boop 🤖💕


9:20 Previously on Beep Boop... we catch folks up on what they missed last episode! 🔁


14:17 We introduce what we&#x27;ll be working on this week, a Microsoft Learn module where we&#x27;ll learn how to create a web app that uses data to make decisions on the basketball court 🏀 


15:08 One of our awesome viewers tells us about a VS Code extension that rainbow-ifies CSV files! 🌈📁


16:20 A refresher on what tools you&#x27;ll need to download to follow along with this session - VS Code, an Azure account, and a few other bits and bobs ☁️🧵


18:04 Now that our data is squeaky clean 🧼, let&#x27;s double check that we&#x27;ve set up our local environment


25:14 We merge the two datasets, and add identifiers to our DataFrame so that we know who&#x27;s who 👀🐰


30:38 We start our new machine learning adventure by making a model, and calculating some standard deviations ➗🤓


43:32 First glimpse of our LIVE web app that we just made together! 😳💻


50:45 We learn about the Code Tour extension in VS Code and how it can guide you through adding the JavaScript to your web app 👩🏽‍💻


55:55 Franklin gives us the scoop on how he feels about creating basketball game simulations with the Tune Squad 🐶🦴

The article assumes that composer is already installed and the reader knows how to use it in the command line.
$ mkdir slim-from-scratch &amp;&amp; cd slim-from-scratch

Is it possible to leave the default answers for the composer questions in the command line.

                    <span>A Pure Function is a function which :
Given the same input, will always return the same output.
Produces no side effects.
A side effect is when function modifies some state variable value(s) outside its local environment.
Logging to the console
Making a HTTP request
Mutating data
Writing to the screen
Writing to a file
DOM query or manipulation
Triggering any external process
Calling any other functions with side-effects
Let&#x27;s see example and try to understand.

React router is short hand for a NPM package react-router-dom that allows developers like yourself to build out multi page application through a practice called client side routing. Typically servers handle web routing, react router gives the illusion of a normal web page.
after you have created your app using npm create-react-app double check if react-router-dom is installed with:
npm i react-router-dom
next you will need to import the following code into your index.js

Today, we&#x27;ll jump right into the basics of Nginx, so first up, make sure you have it installed on your machine.
Once you have it installed, we can navigate to the configuration folder where all the magic really happens. Start off by navigating to this path /etc/nginx/ (if you&#x27;re on Linux), you should be able to see an nginx.conf file, launch it using your favorite text editor, and let&#x27;s have a look in there.
