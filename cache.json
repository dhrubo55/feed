You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.\nChanged: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention\nChanged: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)\nThank you @PiyushLosalka",

          "description": "Hooks are one of the most important aspects of any React project. Whether big or small, whether it is custom or not, every hook is responsible for a piece of logic and interactivity of the frontend application. Because of this, it is all the more important that they are dealt with correctly in frontend tests. But there are different ways to mock a React hook, all of which have different advantages and drawbacks.\nOver the years, I have encountered this issue numerous times. A lot of the questions that come with it are: how should I deal with a React hook in my frontend test? Should I mock it or not? Is it even possible to mock it? How should I mock it? How much effort does mocking the hook require? Should I mock the entire hook or should I mock only certain parts of the hook? How does it im…",

But sometimes it takes work to make a reusable flash system. I'm going to show how I implemented mine with Shoelace, but this could easily be extended to any other CSS framework or your own CSS.\nThere are 2 steps to building a reusable interface for flashes. The first is for the backend.\nFlashes are accessed from a Controller, so as such, its easiest to create a controller concern called: Flashable\nIn your app/controllers/concerns directory, create a file called flashable.rb\nIn your app/controllers/concerns/flashable.rb file we're going to add a number of convenience methods to interface with flash.\nBasically what we want to do is be able to call things like flash_success(\"My…",

By default, JMeter uses the G1GC algorithm to clean up the unreferenced objects in the heap. GC algorithms have been evolving for the past many years. In this blog article, I have done some experiments using the various GCs in JMeter to identify which GC algorithm yields us more threads to run in a bare metal medium powered laptop.\nBefore getting started, I am sure that some of you may not agree with the environment setup to validate the GC, base lining the maximum number of threads using the load model etc. If you are not satisfied with this setup, please share your comments so that I can learn along with you.\nI am not going to bore you with the formula to come up with the maximum numb…",
