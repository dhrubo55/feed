Rust is an imperative, super fast, and type-safe programming language that empowers you — a Software Engineer — "to reach farther, to program with confidence in a wider variety of domains than you did before." No wonder it has consistently maintained its deserved spot as the most loved programming language for half a decade!
Using barebone rust code, we will be building a simple command line key-value data store like Redis. It should take in two command line arguments and assign the first as the key while the second, value.
If installed on your machine, it can be used as follows:
┌──(sirneij@sirneij)-[~/Documents/Projects/rust-kvstore]
└─$[sirneij@sirneij rust-kvstore]$ rust-kvstore needle haystack

This should create a file, aptly named kv.db. It's content can then be read:

I am a software developer that loves to code. I am also a person that likes to spend time with family and friends, go out for a run, take in a good movie and enjoy the great outdoors. Unfortunately, my work responsibilities make it difficult to do all of these things because:
I have deadlines
I need to ensure the quality of my work
I have multiple projects that require constant attention
Since I am not getting paid by the hour (except in some cases), staying productive and healthy as a developer is critical. Here are some things I've learned over the years that help me stay on top of things:
It's OK to say "no"


Don't forget about yourself


Prioritize tasks


Make use of tools


Learn from mistakes


Find a good work/life balance


Make time for fun activities


Learn how to say "no"



Final Thoughts
While it may not be possible to avoid burnout 100% of the time, it's important to recognize when you're starting to feel overwhelmed and take steps to mitigate the situation as soon as possible. If you don't, you could end up taking your work home with you, or worse yet, quitting your job altogether.  By knowing the warning signs and how to prevent burnout before it happens, you'll be able to utilize your energy more effectively and enjoy your work more than ever before.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The moment I learnt that S3 Object Lambda was out, I knew I’d want to experiment with it. Why? For two reasons really – at work we have quite a few scenarios when the same objects in S3 need to be presented in different shapes or forms, data extracted, or content transformed. So I’ve volunteered to speak about it and its use cases. The second reason is to practise using AWS CDK for C# more – I’ve mentioned a few times that there are very few examples in C#, and I thought it’s be a good idea to provide one more and hopefully make someone’s life easier.
In a nutshell, S3 Object Lambda allows you to amend the data that you usually get by using S3 Get requests. The main characters in the story are:

This differs rather significantly from CommonJS (CJS), which is the module system that Node.js has shipped with for over a decade that make them relatively incompatible.
There are a number of different components of Node.js that have been intentionally structured to allow you to use standard (as in, how the ECMAScript Specification defines it) ESM by default and extend/augment that experience if you'd like to.
Today, I want to get into one of the baisc elements of ESM in Node.js: the .mjs and .cjs extensions.

Neither you the developer who has to memorize all the algorithms again and cram tens or hundreds of Leetcode questions, nor the interviewer who has to ask the same questions over and over to different candidates and wonders how much work they could've gotten done if they hadn't spent all this time interviewing.
The interviewers don't hate you though, they're not putting you through this torture because they like it. They've been in your shoes, they know the process sucks. They're a victim of the system just like you. Companies want the best possible candidates in the shortest possible time and this is what the hiring process has always been, so that's what the interviewers follow.

When I was starting out I always negotiated better compensation plans than others in the office, even when they were smarter, had a more formal education, or had more years of experience.
Although I started programming when I was 14 years old, my career and passion was sales from the age of 18 to 30.  Being a bit OCD I studied everything I could to be a great salesperson. Zig Ziglar was my idol.  When I switched careers at 30 to software development, those negotiating tactics really paid off.
I used these techniques to negotiate top pay, virtual office, travel and extensive fringe benefits for positions from software developer up to Chief Technology Officer but this works for any job position.

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a "pseudo" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.]]></summary>

Finer resolutions usually translate into lower energy usage and lower heat production. Given that many of our systems are limited by heat or power, finer resolutions lead to higher performance.

I wish to compute efficiently the number of matching characters (same position, same character). E.g., the strings ‘012c’ and ‘021c’ have two matching characters (‘0’ and ‘c’). The conventional approach in C would look as follow: uint64_t standard_matching_bytes(char * c1, char … Continue reading Counting the number of matching characters in two ASCII strings]]></summary>

We can use the fact that the ASCII numeral characters are in sequence in the ASCII table: ‘0’+0 is ‘0’, ‘0’+1 is ‘1’ and so forth.
