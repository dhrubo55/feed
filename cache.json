          "description": "With the newly released Manual Validation task you can pause a YAML pipeline mid-stage. This allows you to perform manual or offline activities and then resume (or reject) the run. \nAs I've mentioned, you can use this new task in a YAML pipeline to pause a run within a stage, typically to perform some manual actions or validations, and then resume/reject the run.\nThis is especially useful in scenarios where you want to pause a pipeline and validate configuration settings, build package, etc. before moving on to a long-running, compute-intensive job.\nWhen the Manual validation task is activated during a pipeline, it displays a message bar containing a link that opens the Manual validation dialog containing the instructions. After carrying out the manual steps, the administrator or user can choose to resume the run or reject it.\nLet's see this in action. We will cover how to configure Azure Pipelines to use it and how to use it.\nHere you have the video with the whole demo and explanation.\n\n\n\n\nLink to the video: https://youtu.be/sfb3d100JPo\nRemember that, as I've mentioned in the video, you can use this new approach only in an agentless job of a YAML pipeline. If like in my example you have other jobs already, you would need to add a job with pool: server to make this work.\nI wanna know what you think about this feature, so let me know in the comment section below.\nAlso, check this video over here, where I talk about the differences between Classic and YAML pipelines for both Build and Release.\nLike, share and follow me üöÄ for more content:\nüìΩ YouTube\nBuy me a coffee\nPatreon\nCoderDave.io Website\nMerch\nFacebook page\nGitHub\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nPodcast",

          "description": "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that uses documents for data storage. MongoDB is considered schema-less, which means that it doesn't require a defined database schema. It's a great tool if you want to scale and evolve quickly, as it supports rapid iterative development and allows multiple team members to collaborate.    \nDocker is a tool that you can use to build applications that run on your host operating system. It runs natively on Linux. Docker uses containers and allows you to combine your application with all its dependencies into a single unit. With Docker, it's easy to create a container and start working with different technologies. \nIn this tutorial, we'll create a MongoDB container using Docker. \nLet's get started!\nWe‚Äôll cover:\nWhy use MongoDB with Docker?\nGetting started\nSe‚Ä¶",

This blog post gives an insight on how I made it into an offline-first app. There are many ways to build an offline-first app so this is a general outline of how I built it and not a one-way-of-doing-things guide. I use NoSQL database so I use the word 'documents' throughout the blog post, but you can think of them as a record of a table in a SQL database.\nI had to understand what offline-first apps really meant. I found different definitions of it around the internet. Partial offline functionality, partial offline data etc. but I wasn't satisfied with any of those, so I settled with the following definition:\nOffline-first apps are apps which can run and function completely offline or without needing the‚Ä¶",

          "description": "The split method splits a string into an array of strings. It takes an argument for the delimiter, which can be a character to use to break up the string or a regular expression. For example, if the delimiter is a space, you get an array of words, and if the delimiter is an empty string, you get an array of each character in the string.\n\n\nHere are two examples that split one string by spaces, then another by digits using a regular expression:\n\n\n\n\nlet str = \"Hello World\";\nlet byWords = str.split(\" \");\n\nlet otherString = \"How9are7you2today\";\nlet byDigits = otherString.split(/\\d/);\n\n// byWords would have the value [\"Hello\", \"World\"]\n// byDigits would have the value [\"How\", \"are\", \"you\", \"today\"]\n\nNow let's use the split method inside the splitify function to split str into an array of words. The function should return the array. Note that the words are not always separated by spaces, and the array should not contain punctuation.\n\n\n\n\nfunction splitify(str) {\n  // Only change code below this line\n\n\n  // Only change code above this line\n}\nsplitify(\"Hello World,I-am code\");\n\nIf you remember from my other posts simply split the string to create a new array of words. A simple regular expression can be used to achieve this result.\n/\\W/ Matches any non-word character. This includes spaces and punctuation, but not underscores. It‚Äôs equivalent to /[^A-Za-z0-9_]/\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n\n\nfunction splitify(str) {\nlet splitWords = str.split(/\\W/)\nreturn splitWords\n\n}\nconsole.log(splitify(\"Hello World,I-am code\"));\n\nLarson, Quincy, editor. ‚ÄúSplit a String into an Array Using the split Method.‚Äù Https://Www.freecodecamp.org/, Class Central, 2014, twitter.com/ossia.",
