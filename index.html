A lightweight TypeScript library for creating particles. Dependency free (*), browser ready and compatible with React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, jQuery, Preact, Inferno
         
This library is available on the two most popular CDNs and it&#x27;s easy and ready to use, if you were using particles.js it&#x27;s even easier.
You&#x27;ll find the instructions below, with all the links you need, and don&#x27;t be scared by TypeScript, it&#x27;s just the source language.
The output files are just JavaScript. ü§©
CDNs and npm have all the sources you need in Javascript, a bundle browser ready (tsparticles.min.js) and all files splitted for import syntax.
If you are still interested some lines below there are some instructions for migrating from the old particles.js library.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m Aya Bouchiha, today, I&#x27;m going to talk about the list of built-in objects.
A list is a mutable, iterable,  ordered collection of values. It is used to store different and multiple values in one variable.
new_list &#x3D; [&#x27;hi&#x27;, 1, False, {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Aya&quot;}, [10, 20], None]

print(new_list) # [&#x27;hi&#x27;, 1, False, {&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Aya&quot;}, [10, 20], None]
print(type(new_list)) # 
print(len(new_list)) # 6

append(value): this list method lets you insert an element at the end of the list.
my_list &#x3D; [10, 20, 30]

my_list.append(40)

print(my_list.append(50)) # None

print(my_list) # [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

my_list.append() # error

insert(index, value): used to add a new element at a given index

                    <span>If you work with javascript, the chances of you are using array methods like map, filter and reducer today are really great. 
All simplicity offered by javascript higher-order functions makes our code more readable and concise, mainly when we work with array data transformations.
Let&#x27;s remember these methods:
const numbers &#x3D; [2, 8, 15];

const greaterThanFive &#x3D; (num) &#x3D;&gt; num &gt; 5;
const multiplyBy2 &#x3D; (num) &#x3D;&gt; num * 2;
const sum &#x3D; (acc, num) &#x3D;&gt; acc + num;

const filtered &#x3D; numbers.filter(greaterThanFive);
const mapped &#x3D; numbers.map(multiplyBy2);
const reduced &#x3D; numbers.reduce(sum);

console.log(filtered); // [8, 15]
console.log(mapped); // [4, 16, 30]
console.log(reduced); // 25

That&#x27;s really amazing!

PWAs are great for your apps because;
Short loading times and overall better performance in poor network conditions for your users.


No need for extra development time to make product a native app(iOS and Android).


Have native features like push notifications without the hassle of  development.


Overall better user engagement



So it&#x27;s a pretty handy thing to have in any react app.  
Note:


If your are just starting your project the best thing would be to run the create-react-app command with the pwa template:
npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-pwa

It would save you the time. If you have already progressed into your project follow along ‚è¨‚è¨‚è¨
Saving it as worker.js  in our public folder: public/worker.js .

                    <span>Being a developer and coder for years, I recently realized that it&#x27;s okay to use no code solutions for things I&#x27;m not as familiar with
It&#x27;s NOT cheating if you use templates or easier solutions, it&#x27;s just being productive
In fact it opens up a whole new area of possibilities that you never knew existed.
You&#x27;ll be able to build quicker and be more productive as you&#x27;ll be able to finish projects faster. And at the end of the development journey, the thing that you&#x27;ll have would be the thing that YOU built
So, don&#x27;t let the lies of imposter syndrome get to you!</span>

How cool is to watch your AWS DeepRacer car navigating autonomously every corner and turn in the circuit with your Reinforcement Learning model guiding it? Now its time to fine-tune the model so that we will try to clock the best time.
We will try to dive deeper into this tutorial and discuss more on the Action Space, Reward Function and Hyper-parameter tuning. I have explained of creating and fine-tuning the model using two algorithms and action spaces. You can choose either one and ignore the rest.
We can train models using either of two RL Algorithms
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
Soft Actor Critic (SAC)
The main differences between the two algorithms are

                    <span>Social login is now an essential part of any site which performs user authentication. It saves the users a lot of time, as they won&#x27;t need to fill the whole form. They just sign up with their social account and next time they can log into the website with a single click.
Using social media accounts to sign up for websites is common nowadays and preferred by users because they don&#x27;t have to remember a password every time they log in to a website. Even though social signup is easy, you can also inadvertently end up with a bunch of very confused users in an app.
Login with social accounts is a straightforward process and simultaneously enhances the user experience; nowadays, everybody knows a better user experience is the key to any digital product&#x27;s success.
Laravel Socialite ¬†is a package developed to abstract away any social authentication complexities and boilerplate code into a fluent and expressive interface.
Socialite only supports Google, Facebook, Twitter, Linked In, Github, and Bitbucket as OAuth providers. They won&#x27;t be adding any others to the list, however, there&#x27;s a community-driven collection called¬† Socialite Providers , which contains plenty of unofficial providers for Socialite.
In this tutorial, we are going to add Social Authentication to a Laravel app through¬† Socialite , an official Laravel package that makes adding social authentication to a Laravel app.

                    <span>What are PCI Devices ?


A PCI device is any piece of computer hardware that plugs directly into a PCI slot on a computer&#x27;s motherboard. PCI, which stands for Peripheral Component Interconnect, was introduced to personal computers by the Intel Corporation in 1993. The technology to operate PCI is integrated into the motherboard of nearly every personal computer manufactured since 1995. A PCI connection on a motherboard can be identified as a long strip of raised copper connectors encased in plastic. This long strip of connectors is usually called a bus.
The PCI bus is not as fast as the system bus. Its primary purpose is to facilitate communication of hardware devices of all types such as audio, video, network or graphics with the microprocessor.

Scope is an environment in which a variable is accessible. It determines the visibility of a variable. We cannot access a variable outside its scope. JavaScript follows Lexical Scoping , which determines the scope of a variable by how the functions and blocks are placed in our code. Following are the different types of scopes in JavaScript:
1. Global Scope: Variables defined in global scope are defined outside any function or block. These variables can be accessed anywhere throughout the code.
2. Function Scope: Variables which are defined inside a function, have their visibility limited to ins‚Ä¶</span>
