The term Jamstack was first coined by Mathias Biilmann, CEO of Netlify in 2015.\nJAM stands for JavaScript, Api's, and markup. It was a revolutionary new approach to building websites. This approach is not a framework, but is actually an architectural guideline using  many of the tools and skills that developers were already familiar with. \nSince it's conception, it has only grown in popularity and is now an important part of a web developers toolbelt.\nJamstack has many benefits and advantages that set it apart from other techniques. \nIt offers better performance, security, scalability, \nDevelopers can build faster with less complications, and can focus more on user experience. Businesses can then be more agile in competitive markets, and make their customers more satisfied. End users get better content that is delivered faster.\nIts a win-win for end users, developers, and businesses.\nJamstack offers better performance by pre-rendering pages and content on build, as opposed to each time a user visits a webpage.\nPre-rendering is typically done as static pages at build time \nOnce an image, video, or other content is loaded for the first \nSecurity is stronger because it has less points, or vectors, of potential weakness. It lives on fewer servers and databases which are frequently targeted.\nIt is more scalable because the webpage's content can be cached in a content delivery network. Unexpected heavy traffic can be handled much easier and this means less down time.\nMaintaining the systems is also easier through the use of a CDN. There is less complexity and therefore, fewer areas that can fail. \nMost aspects have to work at build time, so by the time a webpage is live, it has already been tested.\nNow that you have been introduced to what Jamstack is and how it works, its time to take the next step.
