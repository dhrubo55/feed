          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

          "description": "I recently came across the issue of sharing some data between different tabs of the same web application. Using OAuth to retrieve an external provider's API key, saving it and finally displaying it on our platform. The first solution implied reloading the entire page. But the user experience was heavily compromised. In a SPA point of vue, imagine being in /process/emailing/... and redirected to /process 😕\nWhile looking for a more suitable solution, I came across the Broadcast Channel API.\nIt allows communication between different documents (in different windows, tabs, frames or iframes) of the same origin.

          "description": "My first draft of this post focused on all of the good that followed IE6 in the world of web development but I think it’s worth focusing on why we're so happy to be saying goodbye to my nemesis for a lot of the last 20 years. Later this year support for Internet Explorer officially comes to an end and in mid-2022 it will be retired completely.\nFrom 3-pixel bugs, to different implementations and interpretations of the CSS specs, the end of internet explorer couldn’t come soon enough. Never heard of the 3-pixel bug? If you have access to IE 11, then go here and use emulation to pretend you're in IE5 (IE6 is not available for some reason) and you'll see a three pixel indent of the first paragraph in the green box. Maddening.\nI had the misfortune to not only have to support IE6 in my development career, but also IE5.5 and even Internet Explorer for Mac too. Internet Explorer for Mac. Truly trying times.\nMicrosoft eventually moved onto Internet Explorer 7 but the improvements were minimal. IEs 8, 9, and 10 were not much better and even now 11 is painfully slow. Over the past 5 years, I've lost count of how many times I have been asked to look into performance issues and it turns out it's the browser itself struggling. The code itself is good enough for everyone else, the user's hardware rarely an issue and the APIs themselves performant. Every other browser coped without any issues.\nEdge is a clear improvement on the browser experience for Windows users and long overdue. Built on top of Chromium, the dev tools are there and so are all of the performance benefits that come with things like the V8 JavaScript engine.\nGoodbye, Internet Explorer. You will not be missed.",

Good booleans are derived from well-modelled state.\nWhen you're managing state in your app, it's easy to fall prey to bad booleans. Bad booleans look like this:\nlet isLoading = true;\nlet isComplete = false;\nlet hasErrored = false;\n\nOn the surface, this looks like good code. It appears as though you've represented three separate states with proper boolean names. In the 'model' you've pictured for your state, only one of these states can be true at any one time.\nIn a fetch request, you might model the state like this:\nconst makeFetch = async () => {\n  isLoading = true;\n  try {\n    await fetch('/users');\n\n    isComplete = true;\n  } catch (e) {\n    hasErrored = true;\n  }\n  isLoading = false;\n};\n\nAgain, this looks nice.

So scary, and so hard to remove things from it, firstly because we don’t know what services to remove nor the regions for those unwanted services.\nLet’s focus on how to remove things from the AWS bill, which is the main task that will definitively cleanse our bill. It’s so easy to spin up new services in AWS and forget about them, some might be cheap some others might not be that cheap; and given that AWS—at the time of this writing—provides over 175 services in several regions each, it becomes quite a task to manage all of your services in all of the regions you used.\nEnter the Bills page. Go to your Billing Dashboard, and then on the left sidebar, under the Billing section, click on Bills. Below AWS Service Charges you can see all of the services you have signed up for, and inside each of them, you can see the incurred costs per region. This way you just need to figure out what services are not in use, then go to their regions and remove them.\n\nThis way I was able to spot an unused RDS instance and a very old Amplify instance, both burning money with no returns.",
