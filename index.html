                    <span>Father’s Day is coming up, and my twin brother and I need to plan what to get for our dad. For multimedia notes and brainstorming, I like to use Notion, an app that bills itself as “an all-in-one workspace where you can write, plan, collaborate and get organized.” Notion has options for making notes, adding tasks, managing projects, and more. My brother doesn’t use Notion, but he does text a lot. To make it easy for us to collaborate, I made an SMS bot to which we both can text gift ideas. The ideas will be gathered into a single Notion page using Notion&#x27;s recently-released API, Twilio SMS, the Twilio Serverless Toolkit, and Twilio Functions, making my gift-buying process a lot easier.

                    <span>Los Higher-Order Component son una técnica usada en React que nos permite hacer un re-uso de los componentes.
Es decir, es una función que recibe un componente y devuelve un nuevo componente.
SuperComponent &#x3D; HocComponent(WrappedComponent);

Veamos un ejemplo muy típico en proyectos, obtener datos desde un fecth y mostrarlos en pantalla




Si en nuestra aplicación tenemos varios componentes que van a realizar la misma acción, sería muy ineficiente duplicar el código todas las veces, para esto nos pueden servir los HOC
Como podemos ver en el siguiente ejemplo, creamos una función WithDataFetching.js el cual recibe como parámetro, el endpoint que vamos a usar y el componente que queremos mostrar, es acá donde encapsularemos nuestra lógica, y luego retornamos el componente que pasamos como parámetro, pero infectándole el nuevo state, para luego en nuestro App.js pasarle como parámetro el endpoint que necesitamos usar.




Como ven, este tipo de patrón es una técnica que nos permitirá tener un control mucho mas claro de nuestro código y poder optimizar el re-uso de este.</span>

Sound familiar? Well that&#x27;s the situation I found myself in last week. So obviously, I tried to find a tool that would do it but couldn&#x27;t find one, so like any programmer would do, I decided to build one.
The tool can be found here, with amd64 binaries for Linux, Windows and Mac available in the releases.

To install, simply download the appropriate binary for your operating system from the latest release, at the time of writing this, it was v1.2.0. Once downloaded, make sure the binary is executable and moved to be in yo…</span>

                    <span>Here I begin my #100DaysofCode challenge. I am excited to document and journal my journey on becoming a better front-end developer. 
I first heard the phrase  100 days of Code  on CodeNewbie  podcast. Thank you Saron Yitbarek! Once, I learned about it, I was amazed to find out the growing community of developers blogging about their coding journey and all of the success stories of how it made them become better developers and how they gained useful habits to learn new technology or keep their skills up to date. 
I figured if I wanted to become better at learning programming and gain some new habits. Then why not join in on the fun and blog my journey as well😁. 
For today&#x27;s post I want to start off by creating goals of what I hope to gain from doing this challenge. This way, when I look back I will see what I have accomplished and need to continue working on. Overall, it will help me keep myself grounded and remind me why i&#x27;m doing this. 
 Goals 
 


code for an hour a day
document what you coded in 30 mins
complete freeCodeCamp
JavaScript
understand JavaScript better
be able to tackle basic JavaScript Data Structures &amp; Algorithms
read You Don&#x27;t Know JS for 30 mins a day.



I am determined to complete my goals and even if I don&#x27;t end up completing all my goals. I&#x27;ll be happy to have developed good habits and learn as much as I can about JavaScript. So here&#x27;s to new challenges and a new journey!</span>

                    <span>SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution. This is what Wikipedia can say about SQL injection.
My small definition to SQL injection is an old school technique for attackers to inject a query inside a query to perform unauthorized action against database usually SQL based ones.
Today, I&#x27;m not going to give such examples of SQL injection, but one example could be enough to understand how can a developer protect his application from SQL injection.
Normally this will not take too long, because there only one answer to do that,
you should use prepared statements.
Prepared statements are send to and parsed by database server separately from any parameters, This way it is im…</span>

                    <span>Nowadays, YAML is used for configuring almost everything (for better or worse), so whether you&#x27;re DevOps engineer working with Kubernetes or Ansible, or developer configuring logging in Python or CI/CD with GitHub Actions - you have to deal with YAML files at least from time-to-time. Therefore, being able to efficiently query and manipulate YAML is essential skill for all of us - engineers. The best way to learn that is by mastering YAML processing tool such as yq, which can make you way more efficient at many of your daily tasks, from simple lookups to complex manipulations. So, let&#x27;s go through and learn all that yq has to offer - including traversing, selecting, sorting, reducing and much more!
Before we begin using yq, we first need to install it. When you google yq though, you will fi…</span>

Studying at least 5hours for my tomorrow exam


Learn JavaScript with freecodecamp for 2hours


Build my own project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript



The exam I am preparing is Psychiatry and after 5 good and exhausting hours of deep work(thank Cal Newport) I finished and achieved my today&#x27;s goal.
I then after began to code with freecodecamp(RegEx) and I did pretty well at the start but the overall feeling was: Why the heck is JavaScript so hard ? So savage ?
I needed to cry so bad but I refused to use another excuse of not coding so, I decided that I was gonna build my project.
As you can figure, I am not building it, I am writing this blog instead. Why ? I feel extremely tired, exhausted. The 2 hours of coding I spent on freeCodecamp learning about  RegEx took all my energy and the apathy I&#x27;m feeling now is just...
Why is JavaScript so hard?
I knew that the road would be tough, but I chose it and I am not gonna miss my target. 
I will master that language because I can!(right?)</span>

The thrashing effects of COVID-19 do not seem to be even touching the IT industry as it is rapidly growing and is all set to hit close to $6 trillion by 2023.
The pace of IT market growth is quite impressive. It is presumed that the IT outsourcing market seems to be growing from a figure of $342.9 billion in 2020 to $410.2 billion by 2027, which is unimaginably high in such a condition of global economic crisis.

                    <span>lmost exactly six months ago I started to work for Fresha, where Elixir is a main language for backend. This happend after almost exactly eight years of working as a Ruby developer. There were may reasons why I decided to quit Ruby and seek something else but I&#x27;m not going to dive into it in this post. Instead, I want to share some observations after the technology switch.
As for my background, I did know Elixir before from some hobby projects. I also knew some Erlang from even older times. But my only professinal experience was Ruby or fullstack Ruby (combined with different flavours of JS on the frontend).
Of course, I knew that Elixir is a different language and not just a dialect of Ruby. After all it&#x27;s much more functional, it takes immutability very seriously, it&#x27;s not at all object-…</span>

                    <span>Types of Digital Marketing


There are numerous kinds of Digital Marketing that you can use to expand your crowd reach. Utilizing numerous Digital Marketing channels can assist you with making a balanced methodology that will yield the best outcomes.
1. Content Marketing


Content marketing refers to informational, valuable content like blog posts, how-to videos, and other instructional materials. This type of marketing helps you connect with your audience and answer their questions. It can also help to generate leads and close sales.
2. Search Engine Marketing/Pay-per-Click


Search engine marketing, or SEM, refers to paid advertisements that appear at the top of the SERP. The cost of these ads typically depends on the number of clicks the link receives, hence “pay-per-click.”
3. Search Engine Optimization


Search engine optimization, (SEO), is the strategy of creating content in such a way that search engines like Google will rank your page high on the search engine results page (SERP). 
4. Social Media Marketing


With social media marketing, social media platforms are used as a digital marketing channel. Ads can be bought to reach out to a new audience, or you can create a profile for your business on any social media platform and create posts to advertise new products, sales, or freshly published content.
5. Affiliate and Influencer Marketing


Working with an affiliate or influencer can help increase your audience reach by engaging with their existing audience.
6. Email Marketing


When someone visits your website or business, invite them to join an email subscriber list. With their permission, you can send emails about sales, special events, or product releases. Email marketing is often underestimated, and according to Lyfe Marketing, approximately $40 of revenue is brought in for every dollar spent on email marketing.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>CSS Container queries bring media queries closer to the target elements themselves and enables them to adapt to virtually any given container or layout. In this article, we’re going to cover CSS container query basics and how to use them today with progressive enhancement or polyfills.</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>

Finer resolutions usually translate into lower energy usage and lower heat production. Given that many of our systems are limited by heat or power, finer resolutions lead to higher performance.

                    <span>Suppose that you give me two ASCII strings having the same number of characters. I wish to compute efficiently the number of matching characters (same position, same character). E.g., the strings ‘012c’ and ‘021c’ have two matching characters (‘0’ and ‘c’). The conventional approach in C would look as follow: uint64_t standard_matching_bytes(char * c1, char … Continue reading Counting the number of matching characters in two ASCII strings</span>

We can use the fact that the ASCII numeral characters are in sequence in the ASCII table: ‘0’+0 is ‘0’, ‘0’+1 is ‘1’ and so forth.
