                    <span>While designing a scalable system, one of the most important aspects is defining how the data will be partitioned and replicated across servers.
Let&#x27;s first define partitioning and replication so that we are on the same page.
Data partitioning: It is the process of distributing data across a set of servers. It improves the scalability and performance of the system.
Data replication: It is the process of making multiple copies of data and storing them on different servers. It improves the availability and durability of the data across the system.
Data partition and replication strategies lie at the core of any distributed system. A carefully designed scheme for partitioning and replicating the data enhances the performance, availability, and reliability of the system and also defines how ef…</span>

Before we proceed with this blog article, I would want to inform you that there is a video about this article on Codetopia’s YouTube channel. You can watch it or read this post or preferably do both.





  
  
  What is a terminal?


From experience, I can tell that about 90% of learners who begin their way into the development world or into computing often know nothing about the terminal and often get confused when anything about it is mentioned. What is the terminal? one may ask. The terminal is actually an interface where instructions known as commands could be given to the computer to carry out. Unlike the normal GUI (Graphical User Interface) where the mouse is used to click buttons and other graphical elements in order to issue commands, we h…</span>

Swagger/OpenAPI allows us to document and collaborate with our users, specifically it allows to define the resources, parameters, types, fields and everything that describes the APIs we are building. Swagger and OpenAPI are two different things, it&#x27;s better explained on the original blog post, but the idea is basically this:
OpenAPI: Specification
Swagger: Tools for implementing the specification

                    <span>“When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That&#x27;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it… Once you learn that, you&#x27;ll never be the same again.”
— Steve Jobs
The common reminder, &quot;Memento mori&quot;, is often interpreted as a call to withdraw our ambitions and not take pride in our achievements.
I worry that this makes us too fatalistic, nihilistic, and self centered. &quot;Nothing I do matters, so why should I bother?&quot;
Memento mori is no guide to life. Fortunately, I&#x27;ve found it has an opposite: 
Memento vivere. Remember that you must LIVE.
The way things are is often how we think the way things will always be. But nothing could be further from the truth:
The iPhone was introduced in 2007, 14 years ago.
The World Wide Web was invented in 1990, 31 years ago.
The Personal Computer revolution started in 1977,  44 years ago.
Richard Nixon took the US off the gold standard in 1971, meaning the current international financial system is only 50 years old.
Color TV first aired in 1951, 70 years ago.
Nuclear bombs were developed in 1945, 76 years ago.
Automatic washing machines rolled out in the 1930s.
Home radios and refrigerators were first introduced in the 1920&#x27;s.
Henry Ford first sold the Model T automobile in 1908.
Thomas Edison started the Edison Electric Illuminating Company in 1882.
Alexander Graham Bell made the first telephone call in 1876.
What are we doing today that will find its place on a list like this, 100 years from now?
I still struggle to comprehend it.
These events are 66 years apart.

                    <span>How to create a cool bar chart race animation the easiest way.


Prerequisites: having Python installed on your pc or being registered for Google Colaboratory.
First create a new directory for the project (if you use Google Colaboratory skip to step 1)
mkdir my_bar_chart_race

Then create a new virtual environment, and activate it
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

If you haven’t already, install pandas
pip3 install pandas

Install the library we’ll use to create the bar chart race named, you won’t guess it, bar_chart_race
pip3 instll bar_chart_race

Now that we have the necessary libraries installed, let’s load our data.
In this tutorial, we’ll create a bar chart animation of the 2020 MotoGP World Championship’s title race. If you’re not familiar with this sport — that’s bad — don’t worry.
MotoGP is the premier class of motorcycle road racing. A championship is held every year and consists of many races (or Grand Prix). After each Grand Prix, each rider gains some points depending on his final position at the GP. At the end of the season, the rider with the most point wins the championship.
The point system in use since 1993 is the following:


You can find the dataset here.
Now the cool part: coding!
import pandas as pd
import bar_chart_race as bcr

df &#x3D; pd.read_csv(&#x27;./2020-championship.csv&#x27;)
df &#x3D; df.set_index(&#x27;race&#x27;)

The final result is only one line of code away
bcr.bar_chart_race(df&#x3D;df, title&#x3D;&#x27;2020 MotoGP Championship Race&#x27;, orientation&#x3D;&#x27;h&#x27;, sort&#x3D;&#x27;desc&#x27;, n_bars&#x3D;10, steps_per_period&#x3D;40, period_length&#x3D;2000)

Ok, we’ve done with the coding. You can save and run the program, and you will obtain as output the bar chart race video.
Congrats, you’ve finished. As easy as that.




That was just a short introduction to this library. You can unleash your imagination creating much more advanced races with it.</span>

We are all aware that answering the most basic coding or programming interview questions determines how we perform in an interview. The interview may be for Java, C++, or a JavaScript requirement, but the basis remains the same, that is how strong we are in the foundations of programming logic.
Also if our approach is prompt and subtle in an interview, the probability of selection is higher. So read on for cracking the coding interview questions.
Q #1) How can you reverse a string?
Q #2) How to get the matching characters in a string?
Q #3) How to get the non-matching characters in a string?
Q #4) How do you prove that the two strings are anagrams?
Q #5) How to calculate the number of numerical digits in a string?
Q #6) How to compute the first character of a string that is not repeated?
Q #7) How to get the matching elements in an integer array?
Q #8) Implement the insertion sort algorithm.
Q #9) How to perform swapping two strings by not using a third variable?
Q #10) Implement the process of reversing a linked list.
Q #11) How to get the length of a linked list?
Q #12) How to verify if a number is prime or not?
Q #13) Compute the first five Fibonacci numbers.
Q #14) How to reverse a number?
Q #15) Determine the factors of a number.

This exercise was all about Object and Arrays and making a reference vs. a copy and how they can be manipulated. If you make a reference to an array and update that array it will edit the original array as well because it is an array reference and not an array copy. So they both are pointing to the same array. To fix this a copy needs to be made instead. There are a few techniques to do this. You could .slice() to make a copy of an array. You can also create a new array and concat the old one or even use the ES6 spread operator. When those new copies of arrays are created and updated, the original one is not changed. This also applies to objects.</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Most of us have come across terms like multithreading, parallel processing, multiprocessing, concurrency, etc., though each of these terms has its own meaning. In a broader sense, we need these because we want to avoid some kind of latency (or have an illusion of doing so) in the execution of regular programs.
To do this, we try to write code that doesn’t necessarily runs in order (non-sequential) and all this boils down to two different concepts — concurrency and parallelism.
I came across concurrency when I was trying to download ~5000 images from the web. I had collected image URLs from Flickr, and these images had to be passed on to a team doing annotation (labelling).
This is how a sequential program to download images would look like:
import requests

Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) software tool created by HashiCorp. 
Users define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).
Terraform manages external resources (such as public cloud infrastructure, private cloud infrastructure, network appliances, software as a service, and platform as a service) with &quot;providers&quot;

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>All models are wrong, but some are useful is a common saying in statistics. It does not merely apply to statistics, however. It is general observation.

He says that you make progress by successively making models followed by experiments, followed by more models, and then more … Continue reading All models are wrong</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
