But all too often, developers don't think about whether their code will work until it's finished, and by then they've already created many bugs that are difficult or impossible to fix.  \nThat's why every developer should be using Test Driven Development (TDD). TDD forces you to \"think before you act\" and come up with a test before writing any new lines of code. This simple technique has been shown in studies done at Microsoft Research and elsewhere to reduce programming errors by as much as 50 percent--an amazing reduction in mistakes! And because TDD prevents so many bugs from creeping into your software, it also makes future debugging sessions shorter and reduces technical debt.\nWhen deve…",
