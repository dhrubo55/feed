That's why I decided to do this memory aid and given that my memory is not that good I thought why not make a monstrous memory aid with all the concepts I know about React.
So I can read it from time to time and thereby strengthen my knowledge of React.
If you have ideas or recommendation do not hesitate and do so in the comments section.

Notice in the example below that the eat method is shared by Cat and Bear:




function Cat(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Cat.prototype = {
  constructor: Cat,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");

function Bear(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Bear.prototype = {
  constructor: Bear,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");

};

The eat method is repeated in two places. The code can be edited to follow the DRY principle by creating a supertype (or parent) called Animal:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just like people inherit genes from their parents, an object inherits its prototype directly from the constructor function that created it. For example, here the Dog constructor creates the beagle object:




function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

beagle inherits its prototype from the Dog constructor function. You can show this relationship with the isPrototypeOf method:




Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle);

This would return true.
All objects in JavaScript (with a few exceptions) have a prototype. Also, an object‚Äôs prototype itself is an object.




function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

typeof Dog.prototype; // yields object

Because a prototype is an object, a prototype can have its own prototype! In this case, the prototype of Bird.prototype is Object.prototype:


How is this useful? You may recall the hasOwnProperty method from a previous post:




let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");
beagle.hasOwnProperty("name");

The hasOwnProperty method is defined in Object.prototype, which can be accessed by Dog.prototype, which can then be accessed by beagle. This is an example of the prototype chain. In this prototype chain, Dog is the supertype for beagle, while beagle is the subtype. Object is a supertype for both Dog and beagle. Object is a supertype for all objects in JavaScript. Therefore, any object can use the hasOwnProperty method.]]></summary>

The term "object" denotes two kinds of objects: the key-value data structure in JavaScript, and the popular but opinionated programming methodology: OOP . This article is about the latter type of object.
In JavaScript, [almost] everything is an object. To understand the language in-depth, you first have to know what objects are and how they work.
An object is used to store key-value data. It allows for various data and complex entities to be stored. Entities within an object are known as properties. A property is a "key-value" pair, where the key is the property name and value can be anything
To create an object, the curly braces {...} is used with a list of optional properties. It's possible to initialize an empty object.

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
