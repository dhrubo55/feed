Accessing state immediately after calling the updater method can potentially return the old value.\nThere is no guarantee of synchronous operation of state update calls and multiple state updates can be batched for performance reasons.\nState updates alter the virtual DOM and cause re-rendering which may be an expensive operation.

          "description": "Well, Hi there! This is my first Dev.to post, and I'm really excited to begin here! üòÅ\nPerhaps, you already know me from my Tumblr, or my Medium. But nice, and original content will be written here, so take a seat!\nTo start off, I decided to share a little piece of mathematical knowledge, that, although simple, it is very common to forget, or simply don't come across. But is very useful, and, if you want to follow the path of machine learning, for instance, it is a must know basic concept.\nSo let's jump in!\nO.b.s: I'm assuming you already know the base concepts of statistics. Such as average, mode and median.\nYou can think variance, just like the average means like the \"center\" of the data, variance can mean how the data actually behaves around that \"center\".\nFor instance, let's take the mean of these table, which show how many hours of sleep Greg had last week:\n\n\n\nWeek day\nHours Slept\n\n\n\n\nMonday\n7 hours\n\n\nTuesday\n8 hours\n\n\nWednesday\n6 hours\n\n\nThursday\n0 hours\n\n\nFriday\n7 hours\n\n\nSaturday\n7 hours\n\n\nSunday\n10 hours\n\n\n\nThis data gives as a average of: 7,6 hours slept per night.\nBut, let's change the question here, and if we want to know Àúhow constantÀú is the sleeping behavior of Greg?\nSo, now we want to know, having an average behavior of 7,6 hour slept/night, how constant was these hours?\nVariance is defined by:\nŒ£(average - x)¬≤ / n \n\n-> x being the hours slept.\n-> n being the amount of data.\n\nSo, the example above would evaluate to:\n(7-6.42)¬≤ + (8-6.42)¬≤ + (6-6.42)¬≤ + (0-6.42)¬≤ + (7-6.42)¬≤ + (7-6.42)¬≤ + (10-6.42)¬≤\n\nwhich would result: 10.38\nNow that you understood variance, the standard deviation, is used to minimize the noise made by the ¬≤'s on variance's formula.\nCalculate de SD by: sqrt(variance)\nIn our case, it will be: 3.22\nIf you're a little advanced in Maths, you can think of variance as the value of a function y, and the SD being the derivative of the same function. üòâ\nBoth have lots of use-cases, that I pretend to bring here on future posts. Hope it helps! üòÅ",

          "description": "Have you encountered a challenge where you need to fetch records from the database in no particular order using Laravel?\nI found myself at this point once and here is how I solved it. All thanks to dear Google!üòç\nThis is a regular SQL query to fetch records randomly:\nselect * from `users` order by RAND() ```\n\n\n\nBut in Laravel, there is a method named\n\n ```inRandomOrder()```\n\n which simply fetches the records in random order.\n\nHere is a list of the few ways this method can be used:\n\n\n\n\n```PHP\n\n//Fetch all records in random order\nModel::inRandomOrder()->get();\n\n// 5 indicates the number of records\nModel::inRandomOrder()->limit(5)->get();\n\n//Fetc all records in pages or sets of 6\nModel::inRandomOrder()->paginate(6)->get();\n\n// get one random record\nModel::inRandomOrder()->first()\n\nThe helper method can also be used like this:\nModel::where('name',$name)->inRandomOrder()->get();\n\nPS: The inRandomOrder() method can also be used alongside other helper methods for fetching records like paginate() and limit().\nI trust this will be of great assistanceü•∞. I would also love to learn more about this so please feel free to drop your comments or send a direct message on  twitter.\nThank youüòé",

Vim is a great option for doing this, or probably the best out there! Because Vim is pre-installed in almost every Linux distribution. This is not an in-depth setup for BASH on Vim, it is a simple editorial on starting up BASH scripting on the Vim editor. So without wasting time on \"Vim features\" let's dive in with the setup for BASH in Vim.\nSetting up a bash script doesn't require much code but still in some cases it can be a bit hassle and to avoid the repetitive task, one can easily set up a macro for the boilerplate BASH script.\nnnoremap bs i#!/bin/bash/<ESC>o\n\nOk that was p‚Ä¶",
