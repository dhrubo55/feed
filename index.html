pipenv shell #this initializes with Pipfile and creates the environment

We install our django application
pipenv install django

We create a new django project

We create our app blog and add it to INSTALLED_APPS.

Ockam is a rust library that makes it simple for distributed applications to guarantee end-to-end integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of data.
In this post, we&#x27;ll create two small Rust programs called Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob will send each other messages, over the network, via a cloud service. They will mutually authenticate each other and will have a cryptographic guarantee that en-route messages were not tampered or forged.
The intermediary cloud service and attackers on the network will not be able to see or change the contents of en-route messages. In later examples we&#x27;ll also see how we can have this end-to-end protection even when the communication path between Alice and Bob is more complex - with multiple transport connections, a variety of…</span>

• URL changes every 6 hrs, with 130 char long, therefore making it impossible to trace by anyone other than Telegram.

• It works by creating an ECDSA encryption 🔑🗝key pair, returns you the 🔑public key, to distribute.
• To encrypt, one will have to send your 🔑key along with ✉text and 🖼image.
• The bot will encrypt the text and hide it then it will return the 🖼 encode-image.
• You as a recipient will send the encoded-image to the bot. and it will take your 🗝private key from the 📒database and will send you the hidden ✉text.
PS: Icon is not just eye-candy for otakus. try &quot;/icon&quot; command, within the bot. I bet you will love it. 😉

  Hold Down Alt when Selecting Text


Let’s say you have a list of variables and you decide to change the scope from public to protected. You could use find and replace on the selected text, or you could just copy/paste over each modifier. Another option is block selecting. Holding down the Alt key while selecting allows you to include multiple lines to the position of the cursor rather than the entire line. The result is that when you type, cut or paste, it applies to every line selected. You could select all the public modifiers and simply type or paste protected to edit them all at once.

Cut and paste? What is so special about these? In Visual Studio. If you have nothing selected, the cut command will cut the entire line and paste will insert the entire line…</span>
