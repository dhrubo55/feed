You know basic data structures(list, dict, tuple and set) in python.
You are familiar with NumPy Basics. If not, check out my colab notebook where I have explained it from the ground up :)
You have already setup your Data Science environment.
Numpy has the following limitations:


No support for column names.
datatype of all elements must be the same.
No pre-built methods for common analysis tasks.
Pandas can handle a large amount of data at ease!
Pandas library overcomes the limitations of NumPy, and sometimes it is also referred to as a swis army knife of Data Analysis!
And don&#x27;t you worry about losing the vectorization power, Pandas is built upon NumPy so internally, it makes use of NumPy code extensively!

                    <span>Plug: I help develop million: &lt;1kb virtual DOM - it&#x27;s fast!
The virtual DOM is a tree of virtual nodes that represents what the DOM looks like. virtual nodes are light, stateless, and are JavaScript objects that only contain necessary fields. virtual nodes can be assembled into trees, and &quot;diffed&quot; to make pinpoint changes to the DOM.
The reasoning behind this is because modification and access of DOM nodes is computationally expensive. A diff between virtual nodes, accessing the DOM only for modification, is the premise of virtual DOM. It avoids the DOM as much as possible, favoring plain JavaScript objects instead, making reading and writing much cheaper.
The Million virtual DOM contains three main functions: m, createElement, patch. To completely understand how virtual DOM works, let&#x27;s t…</span>

                    <span>A stack uses LIFO (last-in-first-out) ordering, the most recent item added is the first item to be removed, just like a real stack.

A stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list, can be either fixed or dynamic size.
Push - Add an item to the top of the stack
Pop - Remove the top item from the stack
Peek - Return the top of the stack, without removing it.
isEmpty - Return true if the stack is empty.
isFull - Return true if the stack is full, used when the stack is fixed size.
Here&#x27;s an implementation of a stack using an array, in Typescript an array doesn&#x27;t have a fixed length, so the operation isFull is not required, however you can implement a stack with a fixed length and use that operation.
class Stack {
  private array: T[] &#x3D; [];

                    <span>In early 1900s German Mathematician David Hilbert put forward a question : 
Which means &quot;is there an Algorithm that can always determine whether a statement follows the axioms?&quot;
In 1936 Alan Turing answered this question by inventing the Modern Computer, the Turing Machine. 
He ran his famous &quot;Halting problem&quot; on his Turing Machine to check whether a program will halt or not on a particular input. 
But results came to Turing such that there is no way to tell in general, if a Turing machine will halt or not on a given input. 
The beauty here is that a visionary question from a Mathematician gave an idea to Turing to Invent the Modern Computer that we use today. 
What? Humans? Yes. To say precisely, they are Women. 
And it was Turing who replaced them with Machines.

Here are five things that I think everybody that writes code should do when they are not coding to keep themselves sharp and to continue learning.
Yes! Talk about code, frameworks, libraries, algorithms, anything that helps you learn more about what you are working on. I think as programmers we often get caught up in the typing of code and lose our skills in other ways to communicate about it. One of the most important skills in our toolset is being able to communicate and explain technology, code, or high level strategy that we are using when solving complex problems. Talking about code helps enforce these skills and even helps us…</span>

Luckily, I got to know about Tinkerwell App in some twitter feed and thought of giving a try.
@mbdgerritsen

      
If you don’t know about Tinerwell app
Tinkerwell is the magical code editor that runs your code within local and remote PHP applications. In other words, it’s a RELP(read-eval-print loop) for PHP.
Though there are some tools like:  
PHP’s interactive mode in CLI (php -a),
psysh
n98-magerun’s dev:console



But the main advantage of the Tinkerwell app over others is that it can tinker locally and also remotely(via SSH). 
Tinkerwell is a commercial app that only costs around 15 USD and really worth it.
After purchasing, you will get an email with a link to download the app …</span>

                    <span>Linear Search Definition


Linear search also called sequential search is a type of search algorithms, that traverse an array and compare each item with the wanted item, if the item is found the algorithm returns his index otherwise, It returns a false value (false, null, None,0...)
The time complexity of linear search is O(n) and his Space complexity is O(1)

def LinearSearchAlgorithm(wantedItem,items: list):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
        Linear seach algorithm
        input: 
            [wantedItem]
            [items] {list}
        output:
            &#x3D;&gt; returns index if the item is found
            &#x3D;&gt; returns False if the item is not found
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    for i in range(len(items)):
        if wantedItem &#x3D;&#x3D; items[i]:
            return i
    return False

/**
 * Linear Search ALgoritm
 * @param  wantedItem 
 * @param {Array} items 
 * @returns {(Number|Boolean)} returns index if the item is found else returns false.
 */
const LinearSearchAlgorithm &#x3D; (wantedItem, items) &#x3D;&gt; {
    for (let i &#x3D; 0; i  True
example 2
input : 3
output &#x3D;&gt; False

                    <span>I get asked frequently by fellow programmers why I started writing online and if they should do the same. Let me tell you one thing right from the start: Yes, you should!
Writing as a programmer has a lot of benefits like additional income, personal development, increased reputation, and more. You don’t need to write 10,000 words every month. You don’t even have to write every day. And you definitely don’t need a background in writing or some hidden talent! You just need a reason for writing, and that’s what this article is about.

Education


Yourself


Publicity


Money



Final Thoughts
But the best advice I can give you is to just start writing. Just do it, for whatever reason. Not tomorrow but today!</span>

The popout shadow effect for buttons, inputs, links etc is a popular style.
So popular, I even use it as the featured button component on HyperUI: Components for Tailwind CSS.
But to create this in Tailwind CSS required additional HTML elements inside which made your HTML cluttered.
This is fixed in Tailwind v2.2.
Here&#x27;s an example of the old way:

There&#x27;s 2 additional span tags here and this way makes the shadow effect slightly offset, an example will follow of this will be linked at the bottom!
The new and improve way using the new before and after psuedo variants:

  Hello there! 👋


Better, right? The only issue is how long the  tag becomes, but that can be fixed with some HTML attribute stacking.
Another thing to mention was the use of -z-1 which I had to add to the Tailwind config with the following:
theme: {
  extend: {
    zIndex: {
      &#x27;-1&#x27;: &#x27;-1&#x27;,
    },
  },
},

A small addition for much, much cleaner code!
As for the slight offset... Here&#x27;s a replica of the example but in CodePen written with SCSS:
CodePen Example with SCSS
If you compare the old Tailwind way, the new Tailwind v2.2 way and the CodePen SCSS example, you will see the new Tailwind v2.2 way and the CodePen SCSS example match. Whereas the old Tailwind way is slightly offset... Odd.</span>

                    <span>The useRef hook in react is used to create a reference to an HTML element. Most widely used scenario is when we have form elements and we need to reference these form elements to either print their value or focus these elements etc. 
So the {useRef} hook is imported from &quot;react&quot; like other react hooks and we use them inside functional components to create references and this can be assigned to an html element in the jsx by using the &quot;ref&quot; attribute. 
An example for using the useRef hook is shown below-
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from &quot;react&quot;;

const UseRefHookExplained &#x3D; (props) &#x3D;&gt; {
  // Creating refs for username and password
  const userNameRef &#x3D; useRef(null);
  const passwordRef &#x3D; useRef(null);

  // We are also creating a reference to the Login button
  const submitBtnRef &#x3D; u…</span>

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>

I wish to compute efficiently the number of matching characters (same position, same character). E.g., the strings ‘012c’ and ‘021c’ have two matching characters (‘0’ and ‘c’). The conventional approach in C would look as follow: uint64_t standard_matching_bytes(char * c1, char … Continue reading Counting the number of matching characters in two ASCII strings</span>
