First of all, thanks to all users that left a stars to this project, it&#x27;s growing fast for being just a new particles library.

I wanted to release the 1.31.0 version when 2K stars reached since it was a close target.
Now let&#x27;s see what&#x27;s new in this version
Added zIndex options, closes #979
Added particles groups to options
Infection is now a plugin, and it&#x27;s included and is not included in the slim version
Changed particles move distance options to an horizontal/vertical object, single number still valid




Here we can see the new Z Index effect, particles are in different &quot;layers&quot; and opacity is not affected by configuration.
Let&#x27;s set a new target to 3K stars from now, thanks for the new star ‚≠êÔ∏è

A lightweight TypeScript library for creating particles. Dependency free (*), browser ready and compatible with React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, jQuery, Preact, Inferno
         
This library is available on the two most popular CDNs and it&#x27;s easy and ready to use, if you were using particles.js it&#x27;s even easier.
You&#x27;ll find the instructions below, with all the links you need, and don&#x27;t be scared by TypeScript, it&#x27;s just the source language.
The output files are just JavaScript. ü§©
CDNs and npm have all the sources you need in Javascript, a bundle browser ready (tsparticles.min.js) and all files splitted for import syntax.
If you are still interested some lines below there are some instructions for migrating from the old particles.js library.

Professional : Not a bad day. Didn&#x27;t have any meetings so I was able to put some things into their final states where it doesn&#x27;t rely on me doing anything else and it&#x27;s in another person&#x27;s hands. Reviewed some pull requests. Got some pull requests I made merged. Oh and when I went to work on that social media site that has been giving me trouble again said my activity may be against their community guide lines. I have done nothing expect accept an invite from a co-worker and was added to a work test group. That&#x27;s it! This social media site sucks!!! I had to upload a photo of myself to be reviewed. I still don&#x27;t have access and they have my photo. Terrible!


Personal : So I got the thumbnail generation stuff worked out. I was also able to get the front end to pull the videos that have thumbnails and show them on the videos archive page. I think I&#x27;ll have it all ready for the next live streams on Sunday. I want to get the videos in the dashboard so I can edit, deleted, get thumbnails generated for old videos etc. That will probably come after my next thing which is to get the details and transcripts of the archived videos automatically created with an API I&#x27;ve recently come across.




Going to focus on finishing putting together the radio show for tomorrow and then work on some stuff for the live stream on Sunday. The new &quot;Black Widow&quot; movie came out so I may watch that or maybe work on my side project. That&#x27;s about it.
Have a great night and weekend!

                    <span>The every method works with arrays to check if every element passes a particular test. It returns a Boolean value true if all values meet the criteria, false if not.


Example, the following code would check if every element in arr is positive.




function check(arr) {
return arr.every(function(num) {
  return num &gt; 0;
})

}
console.log(check([1, 2, 3, -4, 5]));

check([1, 2, 3, -4, 5]) should return false




  
  
  Using the some Method



The some method works with arrays to check if any element passes a particular test. It returns a Boolean value true if any of the values meet the criteria, false if not.
Ex:




function check(arr) {
return arr.some(function(num) {
  return num &gt; 0;
})

}
console.log(check([1, 2, 3, -4, 5]));

Over the last couple days I realized I wasn&#x27;t alone in learning the wonders of redux toolkit. So for those of you that are in the same boat as me, get ready for some ducks!



Redux Toolkit is package that was built on top of Redux an open-source JS library for managing application state. The package allows the user to avoid unnecessary boilerplate code, and supplies APIs that make applications DRYer and more maintainable. If you&#x27;d like to read more about Redux Toolkit and its features, I have another blog post available here. 
Today we&#x27;ll be focusing on how to implement Redux toolkit in a React-Redux application.

Before we start coding let&#x27;s define exactly what we want to achieve and tackle each part in incremental steps. This will help us focus on the task and keep track of our progress as we go along.
In a nutshell, we want a widget that updates how the children are displayed depending on the screen size of the Window. It should split into two panes when on large screens; on small screens it should show only one pane and open a popup for the second pane as needed:

                    <span>Perhaps my personal favorite recommendation for learning to program Ruby like a Rubyist, Eloquent Ruby is a book I recommend frequently to this day. That said, it was released in 2011 and things have changed a bit since then.
This series will focus on reading over Eloquent Ruby, noting things that may have changed or been updated since 2011 (around Ruby 1.9.2) to today (2021 ‚Äî Ruby 3.0.x).
Without further ado, let‚Äôs get started!
Note: This is an updated version of a previous unfinished Medium series of mine you can find here.
We start in with an introduction on writing code that looks and feels like Ruby.
The first example in practice is the following class:
class Document
  attr_accessor :title, :author, :content

  def initialize(title, author, content)
    @title &#x3D; title
    @author &#x3D; a‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>The Compound Pattern allows you to associate one or more sub-components to a component. These can be repeated and reallocated. Above all, they allow you to encapulate the structure, style and logic relating to a portion of the UI.
The High Order Component is the extension in the React context of the High Order Function. Basically it is a function that wraps a component and enhances it and/or injects additional functionality.
Have you ever tried to use the second over the first? If so, you will have realized that React will complain. I&#x27;ll tell you more - he&#x27;s right.
Create Compound Component (more)
Create High Order Component (more)
Merging... it fails!
Reasoning to the solution
Abstract away the problem
