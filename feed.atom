toFixed(digits) returns as a string the specified number rounded to a given number of decimals.

All projects should have a semantic versioning, so it would facilitate the use of specific versions as dependencies and old versions for specific platforms or even avoid that bug that appeared in the X.Y.Z version of the project.
Simple set of rules and requirements that determine how version numbers are assigned and in turn incremented.
MAJOR: when you make incompatible API changes;
MINOR: when you add backward-compatible functionality;
PATCH: when you fix backward compatible bugs.
You can read more about the specification at: https://semver.org/
When you are going to update a project and want to know what has changed, you go after all the previous releases and the changelog is a file that makes this easier for you and your users.
Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There must be an entry for each version.
Changes of the same type must be grouped together.
Versions and sections must be linked (with links).
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.
Mention whether you follow semantic versioning.
Create your tags to help view the changelog, if you need help here are some patterns:
You can read more about it at: https://keepachangelog.com/
If you have any questions, complaints or tips, you can leave them here in the comments. I will be happy to answer!
😊😊See you! 😊😊]]></summary>

It's amazing what you can cook up by mixing together a few hooks.  I thought I'd put together an overview of how to make a powerful useAsync hook that allows you to do all sorts of cool progress animations.
Here's a sneak peek at it updating multiple areas of a React app:




As you can see multiple parts of the interface update independently and we can restart the operation by changing a few deps - which cancels the previous operation.
For the purpose of this hook we are going to combine the useMemo, useState, and useRef hooks to produce a useAsync hook that takes an async function which gets passed some utility functions which can be used to provide intermediate results as it executes, check whether the function should cancel and restart the operation…]]></summary>

Estimating the cost of a new product is fundamentally difficult, and people are not very good at predicting events accurately. No project repeats another, each is unique not only in its goals, but also in the countless features that shape it. Often a problem that is simple at first glance turns out to be much more complicated from the inside, and sometimes it requires serious technical improvements to solve it. And, undoubtedly, in any project there are always many unknowns that arise already in the process of working on it.

In addition, there are no identical people - no customers, no developers, no users. We all start working with our baggage of knowledge, experience, values, expectations, willingness to take risks and adaptability.

There are many tools and techniques to examine an executable and this post is about that and a little bit of reverse engineering.
As an example I wrote a pretty basic piece of code with some intentional inclusions. There are two global variables msga and msgb. Two user defined routines allow and deny that get executed inside the main function. One conditional call to an external program using execvp. The idea here is to examine the executable this program creates. Find out where the code I wrote lands in the executable and what compiler adds on top of it.
