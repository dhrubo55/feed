                    <span>Well well! The motivation for this post comes from my last post where I had a comment from one of my readers that I couldn&#x27;t agree with. I was talking about functions and closures (also how closures work internally) and how every function in JavaScript is indeed a closure on its surrouding scope but then somebody said, aren&#x27;t all entities in JavaScript objects? I didn&#x27;t see that coming but this wasn&#x27;t the first time somebody put this up. So you will find me trying to break this down practically in this post.
If you can, bring up your browser&#x27;s console and try creating a simple variable and give it a string value. How did you do it? Did you write something like
var myString &#x3D; &quot;That&#x27;s my string&quot;;


 or did you choose to go with
var myString &#x3D; new String(&quot;That&#x27;s my string&quot;);

                    <span>What is REST API?


Nowadays, the word API becomes more and more popular since we are living in the digital era of the Internet. Even if you are not a coder, probably you have heard the word API at least a few times. More importantly, if you are a coder APIs are all around code in many different forms, therefore it&#x27;s good to know something about them. Indeed there are many different types of APIs, and the word API stands for application programming interface, while REST means representational state transfer, and this type of API will be the main focus of this article. Don&#x27;t worry if those words do not mean too much to you at this point. So what are APIs and what do we need them for? Think of APIs as microprograms or microservices that help us with various different tasks and connect variou…</span>

                    <span>Greetings and salutations !


Let&#x27;s install Ubuntu terminal on your windows 10 computer.
START button, and type :
Turn Windows Features On/Off
Drag the windows list down and make sure that 
windows subsystem for Linux is checked.
Click Ok, then restart your computer.


 
When you will come back, open your command prompt and type bash, you&#x27;ll find a message tellin&#x27; you that no linux distributions are currently installed, or somehtin&#x27; like that :) 
Go to Microsoft Store, and search for Linux, you will find a lot of distros from which you can choose : Kali, Ubuntu, etc...

Install your desired distro, and you will be ready to rock and roll; let&#x27;s say you installed Ubuntu, you will find Ubuntu&#x27;s terminal app in the start menu; click on that and wait :
Installing, this may take a few minutes...
Once finished, you can start working on your Ubuntu Bash Terminal.
What is Linux ? An operating system ? No!

Basic Bash Terminal Commands:
pwd — When you first open the terminal, you are in the home directory of your user. 
The root is the base of the Linux file system. It is denoted by a forward slash( / ). 



ls — Use the &quot;ls&quot; command to list the files that are in the current directory. 




You can list contents of a a specific folder, let&#x27;s say documents : 
~$ ls \documents
cd — Use the &quot;cd&quot; command to go to a directory. For example, if you are in the home folder, and you want to go to the downloads folder, then you can type in:
~$cd Downloads
~$cd ..
For more Linux commands, watch my Bash commands for beginners.

                    <span>TL;DR
I have been using keyboards since I was 14 when I wrote my first characters on a notepad file and haven&#x27;t stopped since. I am using one as I am typing this post and I think it&#x27;s one of the most underrated components of what people prefer to refer as a computer. 
After a few weeks of research I decided I wanted to build my own keyboard.
first build (v1)
Research (lots of hours)
Order the parts/components (less than an hour)
Start building the keyboard (couple of days)
Success (nope)
Unfortunately my first attempt failed as I did a couple of mistakes when trying to solder my keyboard and ended up deforming the pcb to a point where it wouldn&#x27;t fit the case. Sad times :(
Three years after my first attempt and a lot more research I decided I wanted to have another go at it. 
first build (v2)
Research (lots of hours)
Order the parts/components (less than an hour)
Start building the keyboard (couple of hours)
Success (YESSS!!!!)

Lubing stabilisers , it was hard. People posting videos online (thank you) make it look so easy but it&#x27;s not. It requires a lot of practice and patience.
Screwing the pcb to the case was a test of my patience. The screws are so small and it does need a professional screwdriver otherwise you end up spending a lot of time trying to fit them in.
Hot swappable pcb is a game changer (for newbies) 
Fitting the keycaps was very satisfactory.
Typing the first few letters from a newly build mechanical keyboard.
It&#x27;s a great hobby but very addictive. It makes you appreciate the importance of typing - very powerful.
Next step on my keyboard journey is programming multiple layers of keys and doing less typos. More on that soon...</span>

                    <span>An Array is a data type in JavaScript used for storing a collection of like data. In our daily activities, we always find ourselves grouping things that are alike together, sometimes we even find ourselves being grouped with people that we share a common function or attribute.
An array is how we can represent this group together in javascript. Different names can be used to mean an array, some are collection, group, list, etc. But with the names, I believe you can get an idea of what Javascript array is all about.
Say we have a list (array, group, collection) of all the student&#x27;s names of a class, we could represent this in JavaScript thus
const studentNames &#x3D; [
  &#x27;Dwayne Johnson&#x27;,
  &#x27;Lionel Messi&#x27;,
  &#x27;Kevin Hart&#x27;,
  &#x27;Elon Musk&#x27;,

                    <span>Introduction:
Hello, my name is Arif Iqbal. I am a Web Developer from Pakistan. I would like to start writing on DEV. My motivation behind writing on the DEV is becoming a better web developer, sharing my knowledge, and receiving feedback. Also, to document my learning and things I work on. This will primarily benefit me by looking back at what I have been working on, but it may be helpful for others too.
In fact, I have been thinking about this for a long time and procrastinated hard on this, until I saw this post two days ago
Yes, you should write that first post!

What would I like to hear from you?
How did you start writing on DEV and how is it going on?
What did you stop from taking the initiative and how did you overcome it?
If English is not your primary language, do you care about the English of your post?
How do you manage time for it with the job and other responsibilities?
Do you have any advice for me to stay consistent here?

                    <span>Beside functions being first class citizens in JavaScript, there are plenty of other features, allowing functions to make an extra mile ride. Closures are one of them. 
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment)
Mozilla 
Let&#x27;s take an example:
function adder(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return a + b;
  };
}

let add5 &#x3D; adder(5);
let add10 &#x3D; adder(10);

console.log(add5(2));  // 7
console.log(add10(2)); // 12

From above code, it&#x27;s clear how closures work, and how it remembers the lexical scope, the function was declared within. But how this could be useful, or is it just non-practical questions in JavaScript interviews? 
Don&#x27;t worry, we have got plenty of applications and usage, of Closures th…</span>

Implicit binding, Explicit binding in JavaScript
the call, apply and bind methods in JavaScript and how they are different from each other.
These are very important concepts and asked frequently in interviews. So, keep reading till the end. 
this keyword in JS generally points to the object that the function is a property of. In other words, we can also say this refers to the object that is being used to invoke the function.

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>
