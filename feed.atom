        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The splash screen is the first view of your React Native app that a potential user sees. Whether they just downloaded the app or are opening it the thousandth time, users are immediately greeted with your splash screen. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to promote a great user experience around the splash screen.
The concept of the splash screen was created as a placeholder to display while the app is loading. This makes phones feel responsive and creates the illusion that the app loads instantly. While this usually works out of the box for native iOS and Android applications, apps using React Native require additional steps during the loading process. This means loading your JavaScript bundle, initializing the JS-Native bridge and loading React.
"As your App Bundle grows in size, you may start to see a blank screen flash between your splash screen and the display of your root application view."
Users‚Äô phones aren‚Äôt aware of the additional loading time, so the splash screen disappears before React and the JavaScript bundle are loaded, and a blank flash occurs. Although the flash is brief, it‚Äôs a terrible user experience and it can feel disorienting.
Thankfully, there‚Äôs an easy fix! You can add the following code to AppDelegate.m in order to keep your splash screen displayed during the transition:

Now rebuild your app and enjoy the seamless splash screen!]]></summary>

The very simple program on C# looks like the following
using System;
namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}

but with C# 9 we can make it simpler:
System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

Let's imagine we have a class:
public class Book
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Author { get; set; }

    public Book()
    {

    }

    public Book(string title, string author)
    {
        Title = title;
        Author = author;
    }
}

Usually we create objects like follow:
var book = new Book();
// or
Book book = new Book();

With C# we can do:
Book book2 = new();
Book book3 = new("1", "A1");

Consider we have a class Book

Few weeks ago I wrote an article on Thinking like containers, where I did an introduction on containers and explained the problem that containers solve.
The most popular usage of containers is at production environments, because the team can pack up the application into an image containing the runtime and all the needed dependencies. 
Such a process helps to deploy the application in isolation and makes it server-agnostic, meaning that it can technically be easily deployed at any cloud provider in the world.

A lightweight TypeScript library for creating particles. Dependency free (*), browser ready and compatible with React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, jQuery, Preact, Inferno
         
This library is available on the two most popular CDNs and it's easy and ready to use, if you were using particles.js it's even easier.
You'll find the instructions below, with all the links you need, and don't be scared by TypeScript, it's just the source language.
The output files are just JavaScript. ü§©
CDNs and npm have all the sources you need in Javascript, a bundle browser ready (tsparticles.min.js) and all files splitted for import syntax.

First of all this platform is really great and interactive and that's what I needed most in these early days of being an apprentice in learning about web development. 
I started learning about Web Dev in January of 2021 and for the past 6 months I have covered the basics of HTML5 and CSS. 
What I learned so far is:
Don't fall in the trap called "Learn Web Dev in 30 Mins"


Give yourself a time to learn


Interaction with other developers is a must


Do projects


Avoid Burnouts



These are things I have learned from my 6 months of learning and doing some projects in 2021. Hope it will help someone in being a better developer. 
All the best in your journey to learn and be an agent of transformations in tech universe.

Partial is great if you want to create an object with some of the values from a given interface. However when the object is used (via property access or through some consuming type), the object still is a Partial - as in all properties are optional, even if you have provided a value.

In these cases, what we really want is a Picked object - an object with the properties we want "picked" out of the original interface.
Pick is perfect, it gives us the exact strict type that we want, however (as shown) it is very verbose.

In case you missed it, the new ES2021 JavaScript features have been recently approved by the Ecma General Assembly and are now already supported by recent versions of the most popular browsers, yeay üéâ
üìù  Note: For older browsers support (which you should definitely care about), you will need to set up your project with the Babel compiler. Babel will "translate" those new features to some JavaScript that older browsers can understand. Try it out on the Babel homepage!
üìô Proposal

x ??= y will only assign y to x if x is nullish (i.e. null or undefined)
// Example 1: x is nullish
let x
const y = 'Chuck Norris'
// ‚úÖ x is assigned 'Chuck Norris'
x ??= y

// Example 2: x is not nullish
let x = 1
const y = 2
// üî¥ x is not assigned‚Ä¶]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're wearing the design hat before for the first time, here's some tips that might be helpful on your way.
More of a video person? This post is available as a video podcast at evan.streambus.com.

You're used to using things that are feature complete, so you look at your early product and feel that it's "dull" or "sparse".
This isn't an aesthetics problem, it's a your-product-is-early problem. Be comfortable with this stage; don't try and add extra fonts, colors, borders, and other decorations.

Instead, build features, and your product will evolve naturally. 

You likely already have a color palette, but keeping a spacing palette can help you avoid unintentional contrast, especially when you have multiple people working on one project.
For example:
.p-big {
  padding: 24px;
}

.p-medium {
  padding: 12px;
}

.p-small {
  padding: 4px;
}


Make sure it's clear what you want a user to do. If you add a big background to one button, but make another one big and blue, it's not clear which one is "more" important.
To avoid this, plan out what an "primary" button looks like, what a "secondary" button looks like, and so on.

Most icon sets are meant to have roughly the same size as the text. They're meant to be similar to a character.
If you need something big, consider using a stock photo or illustration. Or, consider removing the icon and just letting the text speak for itself.

Many professionally designed websites don't use pure gray-scales (like #000000 black). Instead, their grays are darker, desaturated versions of their other brand colors.
Consider using palx.jxnblk.com to generate a grayscale color palette for your brand color.

Some vector art is better than others, and can distract from your design. Consider using blush.design to get some professional assets instead.
Consider using unsplash images instead of art assets. Or, if it works for your project, consider letting your design exist without art assets entirely! Not everything needs illustrations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed üì∫ Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<replace_with_channel_id>
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos üôÉ
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka]]></summary>
