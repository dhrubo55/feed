          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

My brother doesn’t use Notion, but he does text a lot. To make it easy for us to collaborate, I made an SMS bot to which we both can text gift ideas. The ideas will be gathered into a single Notion page using Notion's recently-released API, Twilio SMS, the Twilio Serverless Toolkit, and Twilio Functions, making my gift-buying process a lot easier.\n\nA Twilio account - sign up for a free one here and receive an extra $10 if you upgrade through this link…",

Once, I learned about it, I was amazed to find out the growing community of developers blogging about their coding journey and all of the success stories of how it made them become better developers and how they gained useful habits to learn new technology or keep their skills up to date. \nI figured if I wanted to become better at learning programming and gain some new habits. Then why not join in on the fun and blog my journey as well😁. \nFor today's post I want to start off by creating goals of what I hope to gain from doing this challenge. This way, when I look back I will see what I have accomplished and need to continue working on. Overall, it will help me keep myself grounded and remind me why i'm doing this. \n Goals \n \n\n\ncode for an hour a day\ndocument what you coded in 30 mins\ncomplete freeCodeCamp\nJavaScript\nunderstand JavaScript better\nbe able to tackle basic JavaScript Data Structures & Algorithms\nread You Don't Know JS for 30 mins a day.\n\n\n\nI am determined to complete my goals and even if I don't end up completing all my goals.

This is what Wikipedia can say about SQL injection.\nMy small definition to SQL injection is an old school technique for attackers to inject a query inside a query to perform unauthorized action against database usually SQL based ones.\nToday, I'm not going to give such examples of SQL injection, but one example could be enough to understand how can a developer protect his application from SQL injection.\nNormally this will not take too long, because there only one answer to do that,\nyou should use prepared statements.\nPrepared statements are send to and parsed by database server separately from any parameters, This way it is im…",

          "description": "Nowadays, YAML is used for configuring almost everything (for better or worse), so whether you're DevOps engineer working with Kubernetes or Ansible, or developer configuring logging in Python or CI/CD with GitHub Actions - you have to deal with YAML files at least from time-to-time. Therefore, being able to efficiently query and manipulate YAML is essential skill for all of us - engineers. The best way to learn that is by mastering YAML processing tool such as yq, which can make you way more efficient at many of your daily tasks, from simple lookups to complex manipulations. So, let's go through and learn all that yq has to offer - including traversing, selecting, sorting, reducing and much more!\nBefore we begin using yq, we first need to install it.

So savage ?\nI needed to cry so bad but I refused to use another excuse of not coding so, I decided that I was gonna build my project.\nAs you can figure, I am not building it, I am writing this blog instead. Why ? I feel extremely tired, exhausted. The 2 hours of coding I spent on freeCodecamp learning about  RegEx took all my energy and the apathy I'm feeling now is just...\nWhy is JavaScript so hard?\nI knew that the road would be tough, but I chose it and I am not gonna miss my target. \nI will master that language because I can!(right?)",

Instead, I want to share some observations after the technology switch.\nAs for my background, I did know Elixir before from some hobby projects. I also knew some Erlang from even older times. But my only professinal experience was Ruby or fullstack Ruby (combined with different flavours of JS on the frontend).\nOf course, I knew that Elixir is a different language and not just a dialect of Ruby.

          "description": "Types of Digital Marketing\n\n\nThere are numerous kinds of Digital Marketing that you can use to expand your crowd reach. Utilizing numerous Digital Marketing channels can assist you with making a balanced methodology that will yield the best outcomes.\n1. Content Marketing\n\n\nContent marketing refers to informational, valuable content like blog posts, how-to videos, and other instructional materials. This type of marketing helps you connect with your audience and answer their questions. It can also help to generate leads and close sales.\n2. Search Engine Marketing/Pay-per-Click\n\n\nSearch engine marketing, or SEM, refers to paid advertisements that appear at the top of the SERP. The cost of these ads typically depends on the number of clicks the link receives, hence “pay-per-click.”\n3. Search Engine Optimization\n\n\nSearch engine optimization, (SEO), is the strategy of creating content in such a way that search engines like Google will rank your page high on the search engine results page (SERP). \n4. Social Media Marketing\n\n\nWith social media marketing, social media platforms are used as a digital marketing channel. Ads can be bought to reach out to a new audience, or you can create a profile for your business on any social media platform and create posts to advertise new products, sales, or freshly published content.\n5. Affiliate and Influencer Marketing\n\n\nWorking with an affiliate or influencer can help increase your audience reach by engaging with their existing audience.\n6. Email Marketing\n\n\nWhen someone visits your website or business, invite them to join an email subscriber list. With their permission, you can send emails about sales, special events, or product releases. Email marketing is often underestimated, and according to Lyfe Marketing, approximately $40 of revenue is brought in for every dollar spent on email marketing.\nThank for Watching\n\n\nI am begin my freelancing career with fiverr website.\nhttps://www.fiverr.com/share/4Xo9q1\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  2 ) https://www.fiverr.com/share/ZRl3vk",
