        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Git is a version control tool that any developer would benefit from learning. Using git allows you to save your code as you make changes, and you can see what changes have been made over time. When working with other developers, knowing git makes it easy to collaborate on projects. This includes open-source and side projects as well as when you are working on a dev team. 
Over the years, I've had practice using Git. I feel pretty good with the basics such as setting up new projects on GitHub, creating branches, resolving conflicts, and contributing to open source or other team projects. I tend to stick to the git commands most familiar to me without trying new concepts, so I'm ready to step things up. 
Knowing your git level of knowledge is the first step to improve your skills. Samuel Fau…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, my name is Aya Bouchiha, today, we are going to discuss 5 methods from the math module that you will probably use in your next project!
If you are a javascript developer, I recommend to you this article:
Your Complete Guide To Math Object in Javascript
math.floor(): rounds a number down to the nearest integer.
import math

print(math.floor(2.3)) # 2
print(math.floor(1.89)) # 1
print(math.floor(7.5)) # 7
print(math.floor(-10.14)) # -11

math.ceil() rounds a number up to the next largest integer.
import math

print(math.ceil(2.3)) # 3
print(math.ceil(1.89)) # 2
print(math.ceil(7.5)) # 8
print(math.ceil(-10.14)) # -10


math.trunc(): returns the integer part of a number by deleting any fractional digits. 
If you're confiused with math.trunc(), math.floor() and math.ceil(), you need to know that math.trunc() plays exactly the role of math.floor() when the giving number is positive, and It play the role of math.ceil() if the giving number is negative.
import math

print(math.trunc(0.000000000000000001)) # 0
print(math.trunc(2.5)) # 2
print(math.trunc(8.999999999999999999)) # 9
print(math.trunc(-7.8)) # -7

math.sqrt(): returns the square root of the giving positive number.
import math

print(math.sqrt(4)) # 2.0
print(math.sqrt(25)) # 5.0
print(math.sqrt(100)) # 10.0
print(math.sqrt(16)) # 4.0

math.degrees(): this method returns the degrees of a given angle in radians.
import math

pi = math.pi 

print(math.degrees(1)) # 57.29577951308232
print(math.degrees(pi)) # 180.0
print(math.degrees(pi / 2)) # 90.0
print(math.degrees(pi / 4)) # 45.0

Laravel follows the PSR-2 coding standard and the PSR-4 autoloading standard. To maintain the same coding standard like PSR-2 for your project(s) there are multiple packages available that can help you fix your code to follow standards.
In this article we will use PHP Coding Standards Fixer to setup it on a Laravel project level.
Following are the steps:
Go to your project root folder and run the following command:
composer require friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer --dev

Some bugs are caused by a programmer mistake while others could be as a result of a third party system or API that our program communicates with. The ability of our program to catch errors and recover instead of crashing cannot be over emphasised.
Often,problem surface when a program encounters a situation that the programmer didn't originally considered. Some programming mistake can range from simple typos that cause the computer to complain as soon as it lays eyes on our program to subtle mistakes in our understanding of the way the program operates, causing incorrect outcomes only in specific situations. Bugs of the latter can take weeks to diagnose. JavaScript is a bit forgiving and accommodating some weird operations without complain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's Friday, it's nearly my Birthday, it's time to address some long running iterative projects (projects I never finish) LRIP for short 🪦. 
I have a bunch of these projects which I may one day finish.
The kernel 🐣🍗 is the entry point of an application (aka your computer) which a Filesystem sits on top of, the kernel provides syscalls to do things like change directories, write files and so on, these syscalls are usually C functions (that's it, no magic, although FYI Rust 🦀 is entering the chat).
Okay so we got functions, an application and how do we use this application?
How do you use your computer without a GUI? That's a trick, don't answer that because terminal is graphical, kind of... But yes a terminal, but the shell, that's what we are talking about.
Think of the most basic shell... Shell not Bash, just Shell, it's just a parser really, type 'cd' and the shell parses your input, cd is not in your bin it's a syscall cd(), cool right? 😴, Wake up ☺️
Get to the point, what do I need a Filesystem written bin JavaScript for, it sounds useless. Precisely, this filesystem offers nothing more than the bear bones 🐻 to represent a Filesystem, it's going to have a lot of extension points (plug-in a function) allowing library authors to represent a Filesystem as a data structure. 
A web server / application with a limited and synced to phisical disk 
Some sort of mock FS testing
Deploy a yeoman style template in node.js
Build an OS real or otherwise
Build the next docker 😅
Browser mock FS
Wasm FS thing
hybrid synchronized FS
some new build system concept
Port it to Rust
Make it work on a real disk (it's possible with Fuse) 




So I'm on my phone, I can't go explaining the code because it's not done yet, BUT it's intuitive I feel, also it's locked down as much as possible so that only a new Shell() can actually interact with the FS just like the real thing.
Such a fun toy, want to help me, get in touch we can FOSS it 🦄]]></summary>
