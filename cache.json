          "description": "Dear readers, this post is about a very useful and important concept of JavaScript. I think every beginner should have this basic knowledge while developing any project.\nIn JavaScript, Promise is a very important concept.The Promise object represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.\n👉🏻 A Promise is a proxy with an unknown value whenever a Promise is generated. \nsuccess value or reason for failure of the asynchronous operation.\nasynchronous methods to return the same values ​​as synchronous methods. \nimmediately, the asynchronous method returns a promise to provide the value at a particular point in the future.\nPromise is a constructor function, so we need a new to create a Promise. It takes a function, as it's argument, with two parameters: resolve and reject. \nsyntax generally looks like:\nconst myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { } ) ;\nA promise has three states:\ni) pending: It's the initial state, neither successful nor unsuccessful.\nii) fulfilled: It means that the operation was completed successfully.\niii) rejected: It indicates that the operation has failed.\nThe resolve parameter is used when we want the promise to succeed. \nThe reject is used when we want to catch the failure.\nThe following is an example of a Promise:\nconst makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject1) => {\n  let responseFromServer;\n\n  if (responseFromServer) {\n    resolve(\"We got the Data\");\n  } else {\n    reject(\"Data not Found\");\n  }\n});\n\nIn the code snippet, responseFromServer represents a response from the server.\nIf responseFromServer is true, the resolve method will be called to successfully complete the promise and return the string as it's argument. \nAgain, if responseFromServer is false, the promise will fail and call the reject method.\n\n\n  \n  \n  (Generally it catches the errors).",

An example would be how we can import a React component and make use of it in different components without the need to rewrite the function or class from scratch. Modules help us to avoid reinventing the wheel by writing the same logic twice. It also aids in the separation of concerns; you can have a separate module just for adding numbers or another for fetching data from an API. This way, you know exactly where everything belongs. Imagine if all of Google’s code was in one single file and every time the team had to fix something in the search bar, they had to scroll through a billion lines of code just to get to that particular section, wouldn’t that be hectic?
