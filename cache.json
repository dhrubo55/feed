          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

          "description": "In my second post to dev.to, I'll describe how you can add your very own Docker containers to Appwrite!\nWhile exploring different backend infrastructure options at Streamlux, we decided it would be best to add our own containers to the Appwrite Traefik network. This way we could host completely custom web servers on the same machine as Appwrite. Allowing for extremely low latency between the server and Appwrite, and allowing us to have 100% flexibility in terms of API.\nIf you haven't heard of Appwrite, taken from Appwrite.io:\nAppwrite is a self-hosted solution that provides developers with a set of easy-to-use and integrate REST APIs to manage their core backend needs.\nFrom one developer to another, check it out, it's awesome!\nNow let's get back to the task at hand.

It’s up to your javascript logic to grab this parameter’s value and use it appropriately. So can there be multiple parameters? You betcha! Additional parameters are added with the following syntax:\nwww.josephamaurer.com/RecentDevPosts.html?PerPage=100&Page=2\n\n‘&Page=2’ is the second parameter that is with this URL.

Do not invite the client to the meeting\n\n\nWell, the most obvious first step is not to invite the client to the meeting. If the client is important to define the task, then have clarifying meetings with the client.\nThe process of estimating the tickets is an internal developer affair.

When your overall project is composed of multiple projects, it is tempting to create one Git repository per project. In Node.js, a project translates to a package. However, managing too many closely related repositories is confusing and time-consuming.\nPlacing multiple projects inside a single Git repository and using a tool like Lerna to facilitate their management worth the effort. This architecture is called a monorepo. It simplifies the versioning and publishing of the components as well as their manipulation and development.\nAt Adaltas, we have been developing and maintaining several monorepos for a couple of years.

All my Redux logic, including asynchronous calls to APIs, was packed down into one slice file (more about slices in a bit). \nAlbeit this being the way RTK suggests we structure our slices, the file starts to become hard to navigate as the application grows and eventually becomes an eyesore to look at.\nThis post isn’t an introductory guide on how to use RTK or Redux in general, however, I’ve done my bit to explain the little nuances th…",
