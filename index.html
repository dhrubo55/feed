                    <span>The user lockout feature is the way to improve application security by locking out a user that enters a password incorrectly several times. This technique can help us in protecting against brute force attacks, where an attacker repeatedly tries to guess a password. ⛳ 
Quite a basic feature for an authentication service, but adding it in my Web API app was quite a head scratcher.
In your startup.cs or container configuration file,   the config for locking out can be  set.
services.AddIdentity(opt &#x3D;&gt;
{
    // previous code removed for clarity reasons
    opt.Lockout.AllowedForNewUsers &#x3D; true;
    opt.Lockout.DefaultLockoutTimeSpan &#x3D; TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2);

                    <span>When debugging microservices, it can be challenging for developers to identify the root cause of issues. Not to mention how frustrating it is to search through endless logs across multiple services and the time it takes them.
With all these challenges, however, there is a silver lining — distributed tracing.
Distributed tracing can help your developers with tracking requests across services (but more on that later).
Let’s dive into what is distributed tracing, its benefits, and the role it plays in your teams’ system. Then we’ll cover which tools developers can use to implement distributed tracing in a cloud native environment.
But first, to understand where tracing fits in your microservices debugging process and why you might even need them in the first place, let’s identify the challeng…</span>

                    <span>When we&#x27;re trying to learn something new, it can oftentimes be tempting to dive headfirst into documentation, articles, and conceptual explanations. While all of that is certainly important, programmers have a great tool in their arsenal for understanding complex topics that they often take for granted.
Building models for different topics in code can help us understand how different pieces of an idea fit together and operate in practice.
In this tutorial, I&#x27;ll show you how to build a rudimentary blockchain with some relatively simple Javascript.
It can be helpful to think of blockchains as augmented linked lists, or arrays in which each element points to the preceding array.
Within each block (equivalent to an element in an array) of the blockchain, there contains at least the following:

                    <span>Hey folks, today&#x27;s post is about a reverse engineering work I had to do for a platform and what I found by doing it 💪
A while ago I acquired a web platform with an android client for a very entertaining project. The backend was written with Symfony 2.X and the client was a native android app written in Java.
Long short story, the backend was a complete headache. I had to deal with different configurations for the server given it was aimed for PHP 7. A lot of deprecations had happened since then so you can picture it. The first setup was good enough, but I ran out of lucky for the 2nd 🤯, this led me to create my 100% (almost there) compatible backend.
Version 1
The android app didn&#x27;t require too many changes. I basically changed the interfaces, some texts translations and added some validations. Version 1 was a pretty straight forward work.
Update to version 2:

Finally I could achieve the expected behavior and things continue working smoothly. It has been a good experience. Now that I have forked the project every new change is easier to me. I could go deeper with advanced android topics as well. This is a practice I completely recommend to everyone in their spare time. Keep coding and keep failing ✌</span>

This is actually something I made together with Tadas Petra and both of us are content creators mostly focused on YouTube. Though we had an issue which was that we wanted to both move in a bit to the blogging space.
One issue with starting a blog is getting traffic, now both of us could drive a bit of traffic from our YouTube channels but we thought that this wasn&#x27;t enough, so we started doing something called &quot;crossposting&quot;.

                    <span>When building an application we often need to serialize objects to JSON for storing them in a key value store (e.g. Redis) or publishing them on a queue.
While there are libraries available like class-transformer or io-ts, there&#x27;s an easier way to serialize/unserialize objects to JSON.
class-transformer depends on the reflect-metadata package. Read this blogpost to know why you should be careful with depending on this package.
io-ts requires knowledge of some functional programming concepts. While I&#x27;m a big fan of functional programming, it&#x27;s not for everyone. (The library is very well designed though)
In both cases we also need to depend on an extra package.
We want to keep our dependencies as small as possible.
What none of these packages offer is a way to deal with backwards compatibili…</span>

This article requires that you have already connected your react frontend to your server, but if you haven&#x27;t, you can check out my previous article about how to do that.

wrapping a Preact component inside a Stimulus controller
loading Preact and the component asynchronously on demand
communicating with the wrapped component via JavaScript custom events



This is partly based on work @s_aitchison
 did last February on Forem. Forem&#x27;s public website uses Preact and vanilla JavaScript. Some of Forem&#x27;s Admin views are using Stimulus. This is an example of how to recycle frontend components from one framework to another.
I&#x27;m also assuming the reader has some familiarity with both Preact and Stimulus.
Yesterday I was working on some Admin interactions and I wanted to reuse Forem&#x27;s Snackbar component:

                    <span>Headings, titles, subheadings etc tell the user about your website. They also take up a lot of the space. So naturally to attract more people and to make your website much more aesthetically beautiful and impressive you can style your text.
Now which style should you choose?
1) Gradient Text

Gradients add a certain feel to your website that really makes your site stand out. Now changing the background to a gradient is fairly simple and common knowledge. Text Gradients can be slightly trickier but they are totally worth it.




Once you have picked the font and set the size you can start coding your gradient text.
2) LED-text

This gives the element an Led-like feel and really helps bring your site to life.




Set the size for your text and select a font. I usually use Brush Script mt for this style as it really adds to the LED theme. Once done set the color(white looks the best). 
That is all for today. Let me know if you want more text designs. This is my first post on this website so I wanted to keep it short and see the feedback.</span>

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>

                    <span>Suppose I give you an integer. How many decimal digits would you need to write it out? The number ‘100’ takes 3 digits whereas the number ’99’ requires only two. You are effectively trying to compute the integer logarithm in base 10 of the number. I say ‘integer logarithm’ because you need to round up … Continue reading Computing the number of digits of an integer quickly</span>

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>
