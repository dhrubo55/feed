        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is the cornerstone of modern software development. While OOP isn‚Äôt the only programming paradigm that exists, I would argue it is the most important to have a firm foundation of, and when used correctly, can lead to stronger and more robust software. But what is OOP and how can you make sure to understand it well? Let‚Äôs explore.
High Level
At a high level, in OOP there are 3 main pillars to understand for getting OOP down:
  Encapsulation with classes
  Inheritance
  Polymorphism (the most important by far)
Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the ability to enclose data that describes the object and the functions used to manipulate that data into one module container. 
In OOP these are typically called classes and are at the cente‚Ä¶]]></summary>

GitHub Artifact Exporter provides a CLI and a simple GUI for exporting GitHub Issues and related comments based on a date range, and it supports GitHub‚Äôs full search syntax, allowing you to filter results based on your search parameters.

The CLI also supports exporting:
Commits
Milestones,
Projects
Pull requests, including comments
Releases

And you can export all of that in different formats: JSON, JSON lines, CSV, and Jira-formatted CSV. And of course if you export in CSV, it means that you can open it in Excel. Cool right?

Also some of the information on learning new techniques with Node.js is outdated - for example the sheer number of Express tutorials you still find out there! Express is long overdue for a replacement, and Fastify fits right in!  One of the first things to consider when running a Node.js server is how to handle logging the right way. ExpressJS did not offer anything out of the box, forcing another bike shed to paint amongst your team.  Fastify on the other hand recognizes that this is a critical piece of running a server and provides sensible defaults - in the case of logging - the pino logger.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before we begin with Higher Order Functions and Currying, we need to first establish what a normal function looks like:
function  returnEven () {
    return 2; // returns a single value
}

function  addEven () {
    return 2+2; // returns an expression
}

A Higher Order function is simply a function which returns another function just as a normal function would return a straight value. Since the function has another function in it, it would require at least two rounds of parameters for a higher order function to be fully resolved.
You can use higher order functions to create partially applied functions. A partially applied function is a function which is partially applied and not fully resolved i.e hasn‚Äôt received the complete number of arguments it requires (arity) to fully resolve.

Most program languages have a sleep function/method that can be invoked to delay the next operation in a function. For example, Ruby has sleep(1000) and Python has time.sleep(1) to "pause" operation for 1 second, but there is no direct correlate in Javascript.

Given this little object, what should game.play() return to us?

  },
  play: function(){

We look inside the game method and see that this sets our game.lives property to true, and then returns a string, that also lets us know how many lives we have.
So game.play() will run fine.
But what if we want to export just this one method to some other file to run somewhere else. Maybe we have a pause.js file and we want to be able to access this method within it, to start back up after our play after a pause.
If we do something like this we are not going to get what we want

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata]]></summary>
