          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

With indexing we can eliminate all irrelevant rows before querying the data so only rows with 'NYC' will be checked when 'NYC' is queried. Here's the same query with index:\nCREATE INDEX idx_state ON customers (state);\n-- convention is to prefix index with \"idx\" followed by underscore and then column name. \nSELECT id\nFROM customers\nWHERE state = 'NYC';\n\nThis query will be so much faster because only rows with 'NYC' will be queried, not all rows, thanks to indexi…",

          "description": "I have been working on an ASP.NET Core Web API application which is responsible for users' comments. This application needs to reject or censor new comments based on multiple business criteria. In simple words, each new comment must go through the following steps:\nCensor curse words\nModify incorrect words\nReject if it has improper tone\nThe steps are not that complex and must be executed sequentially. To implement these steps, I decided to go for chain of responsibility pattern. However, I could not find a simple and proper library to implement this pattern so I created a library called ChainRunner to make all this work.\n\nThis picture depicts how ChainRunner works\nFor each step I created a responsibility handler:\npublic class CensorCurseWordsHandler : IResponsibilityHandler<Comment>\n{\n    public Task HandleAsync(Comment request, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\n    {\n        // process comment ...\n    }\n}\n\npublic class ModifyIncorrectWordsHandler : IResponsibilityHandler<Comment>\n{\n    public Task HandleAsync(Comment request, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\n    {\n        // process comment ...\n    }\n}\n\npublic class ImproperToneHandler : IResponsibilityHandler<Comment>\n{\n    public Task HandleAsync(Comment request, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\n    {\n        // process comment ...\n    }\n}\n\n\nThen, I configured the chain in startup:\nservices.AddChain<Comment>()\n        .WithHandler<CensorCurseWordsHandler>()\n        .WithHandler<ModifyIncorrectWordsHandler>()\n        .WithHandler<ImproperToneHandler>();\n\nFinally, I injected the chain into my class and ran the chain like so:\n\n[ApiController]\n[Route(\"[controller]\")]\npublic class CommentController\n{\n    private readonly IChain<Comment> _chain;\n\n    public CommentController(IChain<Comment> chain)\n    {\n        _chain = chain;\n    }\n\n    [HttpPost]\n    public async Task<IActionResult> Post(Comment comment)\n    {\n        await _chain.RunAsync(comment);\n\n        return Ok();\n    }\n}\n\nGitHub\nNuGet",

          "description": "If you're new to programming and new to javascript, it can be confusing when to use the three declaration key words. We're going to talk about when to use const, let, and why you should never use var to declare variables. Hopefully by the end of this post, you'll be an expert.\nBefore ECMAScript 2015 - ES6 there was only var, but people found problems with var because you could easily overwrite variables without knowning it.  So const and let were introduced.  But first let's look at the particular problems of var.\nVar\n\n\nLet's say you are writing some code about books, and so you assign a variable called book to \"Harry Potter\", but later in you code you forget you already used book as a variable so you assign book to \"Lord of the Rings\". And then a third time you assign book to \"The Hobbit\". So now you've just overwritten the variable 2 times.\nvar book = \"Harry Potter\"\n\n//Now book = \"Lord of the Rings\"\nvar book = \"Lord of the Rings\"\n\n//And now book = \"The Hobbit\"\nbook = \"The Hobbit\"\n\nbook\n--> \"The Hobbit\"\n\nSince var is unreliable, we should never use it. If you need to declare a variable use const.\nconst\n\n\nconst is the most strict with declaratation, a variable can only be assigned once, and it can't ever be changed.\nconst x = 0\n\nconst x = 5\n---> SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared\n\nx = 5\n---> TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.\n\nconst is your friend, it'll save you countless hours searching for a bug because that can be prevented by just using const.\nlet it be\n\n\nWhen we use let we are declaring a variable that we plan on changing later.  The best example is if we need to use a variable as a counter.\nlet x = 5\n---------> 5\n\nx + 1\n--------> 6\n\nx = 2\n---------> 2\n\nlet x = 2\n---------> SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared\n\n-When in doubt of which one to use, use const.\n-Use let when you know the variable's contents are going to be added to or changed in some form.\n-Never use var.",
