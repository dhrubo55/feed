I have done nothing expect accept an invite from a co-worker and was added to a work test group. That's it! This social media site sucks!!! I had to upload a photo of myself to be reviewed. I still don't have access and they have my photo. Terrible!\n\n\nPersonal : So I got the thumbnail generation stuff worked out. I was also able to get the front end to pull the videos that have thumbnails and show them on the videos archive page. I think I'll have it all ready for the next live streams on Sunday. I want to get the videos in the dashboard so I can edit, deleted, get thumbnails generated for old videos etc. That will probably come after my next thing which is to get the details and transcripts of the archived videos automatically created with an API I've recently come across.\n\n\n\n\nGoing to focus on finishing putting together the radio show for tomorrow and then work on some stuff for the live stream on Sunday.
