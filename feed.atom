I hate runbooks. I've been an SRE from since we were called webmasters. In all this time, the least helpful part of my job has been the lists of commands to run when there's a problem. Often out-of-date, frequently lacking in context, and altogether useless when production is burning around you and clients and banging on the door. I'm a programmer. I don't perform tedious tasks, I automate them. Why, then, should I like documenting tedious tasks?
I hate Jenkins. No, that's not quite true. I'm disappointed in Jenkins. Parameterized builds could be such a useful tool, but the input forms they provide the end-user is ugly at best, incomprehensible at worst. Jenkins's pipeline syntax opens the door to some truly amazing abilities, but there's no way for me to packag…]]></summary>

5 helpful Python list methods.
clear(): This method helps you to delete all list elements.
cities = ['azemmour', 'tanger', 'casablanca']
print(len(cities)) # 3
cities.clear()
print(cities) # []
print(len(cities)) # 0

reverse(): reverse the order of the list's elements.
cities = ['azemmour', 'tanger', 'casablanca']
cities.reverse()

print(cities)  # ['casablanca', 'tanger', 'azemmour']

copy(): returns a copy of the specified list.
cities = ['azemmour', 'tanger', 'casablanca']
moroccan_cities = cities.copy()
cities[0] = 'madrid'

print(cities) # ['madrid', 'tanger', 'casablanca']
print(moroccan_cities) # ['azemmour', 'tanger', 'casablanca']

count(): returns the number of repeated items with the given value in a specified list.
product_prices = [12, 227, 0, 54, 0, 20]
free_products_number = product_prices.count(0)

print(free_products_number) # 2
print(product_prices.count(224578)) # 0

index(value): this list method returns the position at the first occurrence of the given value in the specified list.in addition, this method raises an error if the given value does not exist in the specified list.
admins = ['John Doe', 'Aya Bouchiha', 'Simon Heebo']

print(admins.index('Aya Bouchiha')) # 1
print(admins.index('this is not an admin')) # error

clear(): deletes all list's elements.
reverse(): reverse the order of the list's elements.
copy(): returns a copy of the specified list.
count(value): returns the number of repeated items with the given value in a specified list.
index(value): returns the position at the first occurrence of the given value in the specified list, and raises an error if the given value is not found.

The @class directive conditionally compiles a CSS class string.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Svelte?


According to the official website; 
"Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app."
In simple terms, Svelte is a tool for building JavaScript-based web applications like React, Angular or Vue.
Technically, Svelte acts as a compiler.
Enough of the bells and whistle, there are many articles about how good and powerful Svelte really is, let's get right into our first project.
TLDR: Use the online REPL to learn without installing anything locally.
Install 


Node
Git
Basics of:


HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Navigating the Command Line








// download the official svelte template
npx degit sveltejs/template project-name

// enter into project
cd project-name

// install dependencies to run svelte
npm install

// run the development server
npm run dev

Open browser and type localhost:5000, you should see something like this.

This is the basics of getting started with Svelte. Thanks for reading.

To access Dapps users need to use a crypto wallet to connect with, this creates a new challenge for developers who want to scrap and/or test Dapps using tools like Selenium.

An exciting feature is shipping with TypeScript 4.4. It's called control flow analysis of aliased conditions, which is quite a mouthful.
In this post, we'll unpack this new feature and demonstrate how it contributes to improving the readability of code.
const


On 24 June 2021, Anders Hejlsberg closed an issue on the TypeScript GitHub repository with the title "Indirect type narrowing via const." The issue had been open since 2016 and it was closed because it was covered by a pull request addressing control flow analysis of aliased conditional expressions and discriminants.
It's fair to say the TypeScript community was very excited about this, judging from both reactions on the issue:
