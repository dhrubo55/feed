        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm Aya Bouchiha, today, we're going to discuss switch statements in Javascript.
The switch is a statement used to perform different operations based on multiple conditions (cases)
switch (expression) {
    case 'value_1':
        // do something
        break;
    case 'value_2':
        // do something
        break;
    case 'value_3':
        // do something
        break;
    default:
    // do something if the varaibale does not match any case
}

  we need to know that if the variable matches multiple cases, the code block of the first matched case will be executed.
  case: we use it to match against an expression, If it matches, the code block of this case will be executed. If It is not, The default code block will be executed.
  default: is used to perform some operations if…]]></summary>

More important is getting jabbed! So I updated my light to track daily jabs!
The New Colour Code:
No data yet: White
Under 25,000 jabs in NSW today: Red
Under 80,000 jabs: Blue
Under 80,000 jabs: Green
100,000 plus jabs: Party Mode!
Just like the original build, finding a data source to use was critical to making it work. Data NSW didn't have vaccination data available that I could find and I didn't want to go down the path of searching for different API's hoping that one would have the data I wanted.

Having spend some time on my bootcamp working on JavaScript and React, we were given some time to explore our own pathway's based on what interested us the most. For me it made sense to start looking at the back-end, with a view to potentially building my first full stack site. 
First I needed to decide which stack to focus on, and after a bit of research I settled on MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and Nodejs). This made the most sense as I already had experience of React. 
The example used in this article refers to a lesson planning project that has similar functionality to a blog site. Once the main features are setup it could ba adapted for many purposes.

This post is focused mostly on junior developers, but I’m sure its content can be relevant to other positions as well.
There are so many juniors out there. Every year we have thousands of new developers finishing their degrees, whether from universities or colleges and let’s not forget all of the bootcamps, online courses, and self-educated people who just go and learn online. We live in an era where most (if not all) of the learning material is just out there - waiting for people to consume it.

First Stage
npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/ --global
npm cache clear --force
Delete your package-lock.json file(it will automatically get created after npm i).
Now try for npm install
Second Stage
In your project directory type
npm init
npm update
Restart your IDE
Try installing dependency again
Third Stage
Unistall node and npm
Reinstall node again
