What problems does Docker solve?
What are containers?
What is the difference between a container and a VM?
What is the difference between images and containers?
How does Docker help create applications?
Why Docker?
The need for Docker arises from virtual machines on servers being used at large scales. Take a large business for example. For a business that uses hundreds of servers with a cluster of virtual machines for each of their platforms, maintaining these machines is a full-time job. Each server has to have an OS installed, it needs upgrades and patches from time to time, and then dependencies for the applications each machine uses also have to be installed. 
You can see why this quickly becomes very complex. Manually configuring these servers is not feasible, so …]]></summary>

in this type of representation, we use 2-dimensional arrays to represent the graph where the number of columns and rows is the total number of vertices. 
if A[i][j] = 1  that means i and j are adjacent. 
Fast to lookup and check for presence or absence of a specific edge between any two nodes O(1)

Fast to add a new edge O(1)

In this tutorial we will talk about Higher-Order Components (HOC), a widely used react concept and a topic that is commonly discussed in front-end developer interviews. We will discuss what they are and how to write them.
You may have heard about the don’t-repeat-yourself (DRY) programming principle, where we look to reduce the amount of duplicate logic on our applications.
Well, this principle has evolved as a pattern that you can see on higher-order functions on JavaScript, or as Higher-Order Components in React.
Let’s first understand what are higher-order functions, since I think you may have been using them a lot without knowing their higher-order nature.
A higher-order function is a function that takes a function as a parameter, returns another function, or both.

Account for time zone differences

Regardless of whether your team is remote/distributed or co-located, the best stand-up, or scrum, meetings consist of team members answering a standard set of questions and answers. Consistent questions help people prepare as they know in advance what information they’re expected to share.

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<replace_with_channel_id>
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
