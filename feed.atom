Building a design system is a progressive and abstractive approach to maintaining a consistent and cost-efficient components library that follows a specific styling guide and is sharable across multiple products. A design system has always been associated with designers but now it’s becoming critical for frontend developers to understand it from the technology perspective.
In this article, I will share some of the tools I used to successfully build a design system in React. Of course, before building the library, we require the designer’s expertise to develop the brand’s look and feel, user experience, style guide, etc.
One of the essential parts of providing a design system library is to be able to have an independent React components solution that can be published and use…]]></summary>

QR codes are used for many different purposes, like tickets, restaurant menus, payments, sharing a contact or a URL, etc.
A QR code may seem magical to non-tech users, but it is actually very simple. QR codes are simply a different way to write text: instead of using the normal alphabet, that is easily read by humans, we use different signs that are easily read by a machine. 
Since you can write any text inside a QR code, you can also write a URL for example. URLs are one of the most common contents of QR codes. A mobile device that scans a QR code, reads the text, and finds a URL, may decide to open that link.
For example, if you have a restaurant menu online you can simply take the URL of the menu and convert it into a QR code: in this way users that…]]></summary>

Heck, I can even have the option to don't do it myself. Which I can find skilled craftsman or company to do the repairs for me. 
This spawned a cottage industry surrounding the product or a brand displaying their care for the customers. Bringing them tons of good will and brand loyalty like some of these great examples are Allen Edmonds Recrafting Services or Red Wings Repair. 
This was precisely why I personally own 2 Allen Edmonds dress shoes for that specific reason. Because I could repair these shoes in my own country (Singapore) or ship them back to the US even when Allen Edmonds doesn't sell their shoes in my country.

Some modern development practices are easiest to understand from a historical perspective. 
Things started a certain way, and then steps were added or removed as conditions changed. If you don't know the backstory, then the current state of the world can seem arbitrary and confusing. Git branching is like that.
I'm going to explain various git branching strategies with a story. We will start with something straightforward and add complexity as we go. Eventually, we will end up back simple again.
I hope that explaining things this way will give you a deeper understanding of when to use specific branching and merging strategies. So instead of telling you how to cherry-pick a bug fix into a hotfix branch using GitFlow work, I can describe the conditions that would lead to adopting…]]></summary>
