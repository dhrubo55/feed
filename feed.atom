Why?
The projects were thought out based on daily tasks that many web developers (including seniors) face every day.
1. Consume API (Backend)

When you consume someone else's API, you are talking to a third party outside of your system. You could choose what type of data you want to get, should you validate it, how do you want to store it in your database, etc.
This is where you could throw in your imagination and do whatever you want with the data. You could also perform a small CRUD system once you've retrieved the data.
To give you an idea, you could consume Yelp or SpaceX API (but there is a lot more out there):

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm Aya Bouchiha, today, I'm going to share with you 5 useful & helpful methods from a random module.
Firstly, we need to know that the Random module is built-in in python for helping you to create random numbers.
random(): returns a random float n where 0 <= n < 1
import random

print(random.random()) # 0.7291047713945417

randint(a, b): returns a random integer between the given range. a <= n <= b
import random

print(random.randint(1,  10)) # 7
print(random.randint(-12, 2)) # -10

uniform(a, b): returns a random float between the given range. a <= n <= b
import random

print(random.uniform(5.7, 12)) # 10.096664083501162
print(random.uniform(10, 100.2)) # 95.00994365426938

shuffle(sequence, func = random.random): this method shuffle the giving sequence.In addition, It updates the giving sequence and does not return a new one.
import random

users = ['aya', 'simon', 'john']
random.shuffle(users)
print(users) # ['john', 'aya', 'simon']

choice(sequence): returns a random element from the giving sequence.
import random

users = ['aya', 'john', 'simon', 'kyle']
winner = random.choice(users)
print(winner) # aya :)

random(): returns a random float n where 0 <= n < 1.
randint(a, b): returns a random integer between the given range. a <= n <= b.
uniform(a, b): returns a random float between the given range. a <= n <= b.
shuffle(sequence, func = random.random): this method shuffle the giving sequence.
choice(sequence): returns a random element from the giving sequence.

JavaSript Regular Expressions, also commonly known as REGEX. This is the first part of this series.
Let's get introduced with Regular Expressions 📖
REGEX is an object that describes a certain pattern of characters which is used to perform pattern-matching , find, search and replace functions on text or strings. It is also very important when we want to validate emails, usernames or passwords.
The basic syntax of a regex is : /pattern/
A very simple example of searching a regex in a string is, you simply have to write your desired pattern inside the / /.
let testStr = "Search the word regex in this string";
let testRegEx = /regex/;

In this introduction part, I want to leave it just to the basic syntax. In the next part, we will learn how to search a regex within a string.]]></summary>

    filter()
    map()
    sort()
    reduce()

These methods are surely one of the most important and also one of the most confusing concepts, I had difficulty understanding each of them.
But if you’re serious about learning JavaScript, then you can’t escape from them, as they are also commonly used in libraries like React, etc.

When you see styles with color, you can click on the swatch which will open the color palette for you.  Open the contrast ratio , green ticks means the color is in the acceptable contrast ratio, red means it does not meet the standard. The colors within the curved white spectrum are the ones which have a better color contrast ratio, if you choose colors outside of it you will notice that the contrast ratio check mark turns to red. Try adjusting the colors accordingly using the color picker to see what works best.

I've seen a lot of developers use particles.js in their projects. Everyone likes particles effects, but why keep using particles.js?
Particles.js was a good library for particles animations but when I tried it in late 2019 I've noticed some bugs after some hours, not just particles bouncing themself weirdly, an error in my console.
Particles broke everything when I tried to disable particles movement. Is this bug fixed now? No.
Particles.js is an abandoned project, no one is maintaining it, and some developers are trying to code workarounds themself.
Nice, but I think everyone is already busy enough with their own project and wasting time fixing bugs of 3rd party libraries is not worth it
But every library has bugs, true. Particles.js has 280 open issues,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FlatMap is a single method which can be usable for flat and map methods.
As you know flat(), flattening the 1-level deep and map() to loop into an array.
If we include both, we called flatMap() 😉 
So, instead if calling two methods flat() and map(), you can use single method called flatMap().
let plants = ['💐', '🌲', '🌻', '🌹'];

// ❌ map + flat
plants.map(plant => [plant, '🍁']).flat();
// Output
//["💐", "🍁", "🌲", "🍁", "🌻", "🍁", "🌹", "🍁"]

// ✅ flatMap
plants.flatMap(plant => [plant, "🍁"])

// Output
// ["💐", "🍁", "🌲", "🍁", "🌻", "🍁", "🌹", "🍁"]

📝 FlatMap() always do first map() and then it flat().
In flat(), we use to pass arguments where you set the depth, arguments define how deep a nested array should be flattened.
let plants = [[["🌻", "🌹"]]];
plants.flat(2);

// ["🌻", "🌹"]

flatMap() do only 1 level deep flattening.





let plants = [[["🌻", "🌹"]]];
plants.flatMap(plant => [plant]);

// [["🌻", "🌹"]]

Yes, You can also do filter here using flatMap().
let arr = [5, 4, -3, 20, -4, 18]
arr.flatMap(i => {
  return i < 0 ? [] : [i];

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft just introduced Windows 365, a new service that let company cut partners out of the money marking loop by providing virtual PCs to all they customers.
Windows 365 will only be available for businesses when it launches on August 2nd, with a pre-user monthly subscription cost. Microsoft is not detailing exact pricing details until the launches next month, but Windows 365 is designed for one-person businesses all the way up to enterprises with thousand of employees. 

low-end
While Windows 365 seems perfectly timed for businesses looking to tackle the complexities of remote work, Microsoft has been working on the service for years. the OS group at Microsoft had been working on a project codenamed "Arcadia", a service to stream video games from the cloud. Arcadia dates all the way back to Microsoft demonstrating Halo running on a Windows Phone in 2013. This early virtualization work eventually led to Windows 365 and a focus on making it consumer-friendly. 
"When we built this team, we brought in a couple of leaders who had experience with virtualization, but for the most part we brought in people who had experience with Windows and experience with consumer experiences because that was the bar we wanted to set,” says Scott Manchester, director of program management for Windows 365.
Also because of the pandemic, the work on Windows 365 and Microsoft's broader focus on hybrid has been accelerated. Microsoft has steadily improving Microsoft Team over the past year and laying out it vision for the future of meeting, remote work, and so much more.

While Windows 364 has the potential to dramatically change how computing takes place in commercial settings, there's nothing inevitable about it. many will object to ceding the privacy of a local box to the servers of Microsoft. Windows 365 might just be the first significant step toward a future where you don't need a dedicated Windows PC to use Windows.]]></summary>

OpenShift, created by Red Hat, is the platform large enterprises use to deliver container-based applications. If you have read my previous posts about Docker and Kubernetes, you understand the importance of containerization in the cloud.
