        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, in this is part 3 of the tree data structure, we're going to discuss the Binary search tree, and in the next post, we will cover in detail its implementation (insertion, searching, and deletion).
Binary search tree: or (sorted binary tree) is a binary tree invented in (1960) which all nodes that exist in the right sub-tree are greater than the nodes that exist in the left sub-tree and there parent node.
and Both the left and right subtrees must be binary search trees as well.

The space complexity of the binary search tree is O(n) where n is the number of elements.




insert
search
delete




best case
O(log n)
O(log n)
O(log n)


worst case
O(n)
O(n)
O(n)



The time complexity of the Binary search tree becomes O(n) if the binary tree is a skewed binary tree.
Faster than array and Linked list in insertion and deletion.
It is so Efficient in searching
getting The minimum and the Maximum easily
More stack space due to the recursion 
The run time mat increases because of the comparisons.

The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values 
In this post we will discuss how destructuring works on both objects and arrays in JavaScript.
With destructuring we can read a property and assign its value to a variable without duplicating the property name. More than that, we can read multiple properties from the same object in just one statement. This is very useful especially when we are dealing with large or nested arrays and objects. 
At the end of the day destructuring is a syntactic sugar that
In the example below we create the object person that contains the fields name and age. Now let's say that we want to extract these properties from the object.

Before hooks introduction in React version 16.8, the only way to use state in your application is through class component. But now with the help of useState hook we can manage state in our functional components too.

This is the most commonly used property. It is used to print out anything to the web console that we put inside of log().

Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
