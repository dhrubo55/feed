        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Definition of insertion sort


Insertion sort is a type of sorting algorithms that works like the process of sorting playing cards, it divides the array into two parts, part of sorted numbers and other of unsorted numbers, the numbers that are in the wrong order ( numbers that exist in the unsorted part ) are inserted to the sorted part in the correct position.



time Complexity
Space Complexity




O(n2)
O(1)



let's suppose we have an unsorted array [7,4,12,3],
(4 < 7) that's why we will insert 4 in the sorted part before 7
so the array will be [4,7,12,3]
(12 > 7) therefore will keep it in the same position so the array will be [4,7,12,3]
since 3 is smaller than 12,7 and 4, it will be in the first position, so the final array is [3,4,7,12]
if you're not familiar with python, you can find the implementaion of insertion sort algorithm in other programming languages:
javascript 
c++
c#
java
php
=> python:
def insertionSort(items: list) -> list:
    """
        [ name ]            => insertion sort
        [ type ]            => sorting algorithms
        [ time complexity ] => O(n^2)
        [ space complexity ]=> O(1)
        [ params ]          => (items) list to sort
        [ return ]          => sorted list
        [ code reference link ] => ("https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/")       
    """
    for i in range(1, len(items)):
        key = items[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and key < items[j] :
                items[j + 1] = items[j]
                j -= 1
        items[j + 1] = key
    return array

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a developer, authorization and authentication are two terms that you might have come across. Although they are related, they mean different things, confusing if the basic idea is not well understood.
To define it, authentication answers the question, 'Who are you?' while authorization answers the question; 'What are you allowed to do?'.
Authentication can be defined as the process of verifying that the user is whom they say they are.
Some common examples of authentication are 
password authentication
biometric authentication
multi-factor authentication 
Authorization is the process of allowing users to perform specific actions based on the permission(s) they have. An example is a role-based authorization. Allowing different users to perform specific actions based on their roles; user or admin.
We can try to understand these concepts better with this scenario.
Before you board a plane, you have to show a means of identification along with your boarding pass to show that you are whom you say you are; this is authentication. The flight attendant verifies the details you give them, and then if it matches, you are allowed to board.
So this explains the difference between authentication and authorization.]]></summary>

In a fast-paced environment, it is becoming increasingly important that software systems keep customers abreast with the latest information - whether or not they are actively interacting with the system.

These days, notifications can either be sent via email,¬†SMS, or even via popular messaging platforms like¬†WhatsApp¬†or Telegram.

with AutoHotKey you can remap some key behavior to write quick and easy all those operators used day to day.
You need to have installed AutoHotKey and create a file called js-remapkeys.ahk with this script.
#NoEnv ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
; #Warn  ; Enable warnings to assist with detecting common errors.
SendMode Input ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.

Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries. Together, we will learn all about Blazor and why you would use it to build web apps, and then we will build our first client web app with Blazor and .NET.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, when you create a website, the browser loads it at the top of your design, and viewers scroll down. But what if your design is more interesting the other way around? What if you'd like a page to start at the bottom and scroll up?  In this blog you'll learn how to implement reverse scrolling on your website in just 3 steps...
1.Start with just 7 lines of HTML:
<div class="panelCon">
   <div id="pane-5" class="panel">Section 5</div>
   <div id="pane-4" class="panel">Section 4</div>
   <div id="pane-3" class="panel">Section 3</div>
   <div id="pane-2" class="panel">Section 2</div>
   <div id="pane-1" class="panel">Section 1</div>
</div>

2.Few lines of CSS:
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  height: 500vh;
}
.panelCon {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  z-index: 99990;
}
.panel {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  font-size: 30px;
  line-height: 35px;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
#pane-1 {
  background-color: pink;
}
#pane-2 {
  background-color: #e8e8e8;
}
#pane-3 {
  background-color: red;
}
#pane-4 {
  background-color: pink;
}
#pane-5 {
  background-color: yellow;
}

3.Finally, just 3 lines of JS:
$(window).on("scroll", function () {
  $(".panelCon").css("bottom", $(window).scrollTop() * -1);
});

And you're done.

Hello and welcome to my post about Flutter Package Testing. Each week I will test another package published under pub.dev. If you want to see the first post of this series head over to How to validate Emails in Flutter.
This week's widget is a UI Widget to bring your AppBar experience to a new level. The Convex Bottom AppBar widget made you create - who guessed it - a bottom appbar for your flutter app. The widget provides you with a fast to implement appbar and seven predefined styles.
In nearly every app you have multiple screens. By providing your users a better experience, you need a fast way to change between the most important pages in your app. This is often been solved by using a bottom-appbar. Using the Convex Bottom AppBar, you got this feature out of the box including animation and style adjustment using predefined styles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata]]></summary>
