A lightweight TypeScript library for creating particles. Dependency free (*), browser ready and compatible with React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, jQuery, Preact, Inferno
         
This library is available on the two most popular CDNs and it's easy and ready to use, if you were using particles.js it's even easier.
You'll find the instructions below, with all the links you need, and don't be scared by TypeScript, it's just the source language.
The output files are just JavaScript. 🤩
CDNs and npm have all the sources you need in Javascript, a bundle browser ready (tsparticles.min.js) and all files splitted for import syntax.
If you are still interested some lines below there are some instructions for migrating from the old particles.js library.

Here's how to query the database to get customers in 'NYC':

The query will be slow because we've got 10 million rows and the DB engine needs to query all rows to get the relevant data. With indexing we can eliminate all irrelevant rows before querying the data so only rows with 'NYC' will be checked when 'NYC' is queried. Here's the same query with index:
CREATE INDEX idx_state ON customers (state);
-- convention is to prefix index with "idx" followed by underscore and then column name.

        <updated>2021-06-16T20:24:33.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been working on an ASP.NET Core Web API application which is responsible for users' comments. This application needs to reject or censor new comments based on multiple business criteria. In simple words, each new comment must go through the following steps:
Censor curse words
Modify incorrect words
Reject if it has improper tone
The steps are not that complex and must be executed sequentially. To implement these steps, I decided to go for chain of responsibility pattern. However, I could not find a simple and proper library to implement this pattern so I created a library called ChainRunner to make all this work.

This picture depicts how ChainRunner works
For each step I created a responsibility handler:
public class CensorCurseWordsHandler : IResponsibilityHandler<Comment>
{
    public Task HandleAsync(Comment request, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        // process comment ...
    }
}

public class ModifyIncorrectWordsHandler : IResponsibilityHandler<Comment>
{
    public Task HandleAsync(Comment request, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        // process comment ...
    }
}

public class ImproperToneHandler : IResponsibilityHandler<Comment>
{
    public Task HandleAsync(Comment request, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        // process comment ...
    }
}


Then, I configured the chain in startup:
services.AddChain<Comment>()
        .WithHandler<CensorCurseWordsHandler>()
        .WithHandler<ModifyIncorrectWordsHandler>()
        .WithHandler<ImproperToneHandler>();

Finally, I injected the chain into my class and ran the chain like so:

[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class CommentController
{
    private readonly IChain<Comment> _chain;

    public CommentController(IChain<Comment> chain)
    {
        _chain = chain;
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Post(Comment comment)
    {
        await _chain.RunAsync(comment);

        return Ok();
    }
}

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're new to programming and new to javascript, it can be confusing when to use the three declaration key words. We're going to talk about when to use const, let, and why you should never use var to declare variables. Hopefully by the end of this post, you'll be an expert.
Before ECMAScript 2015 - ES6 there was only var, but people found problems with var because you could easily overwrite variables without knowning it.  So const and let were introduced.  But first let's look at the particular problems of var.
Var


Let's say you are writing some code about books, and so you assign a variable called book to "Harry Potter", but later in you code you forget you already used book as a variable so you assign book to "Lord of the Rings". And then a third time you assign book to "The Hobbit". So now you've just overwritten the variable 2 times.
var book = "Harry Potter"

//Now book = "Lord of the Rings"
var book = "Lord of the Rings"

//And now book = "The Hobbit"
book = "The Hobbit"

book
--> "The Hobbit"

Since var is unreliable, we should never use it. If you need to declare a variable use const.
const


const is the most strict with declaratation, a variable can only be assigned once, and it can't ever be changed.
const x = 0

const x = 5
---> SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared

x = 5
---> TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

const is your friend, it'll save you countless hours searching for a bug because that can be prevented by just using const.
let it be


When we use let we are declaring a variable that we plan on changing later.  The best example is if we need to use a variable as a counter.
let x = 5
---------> 5

x + 1
--------> 6

x = 2
---------> 2

let x = 2
---------> SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared

-When in doubt of which one to use, use const.
-Use let when you know the variable's contents are going to be added to or changed in some form.
-Never use var.]]></summary>

Compared to traditional channels such as email, web push notifications capture user's attention more quickly and can drive immediate engagement, which is ideal for time-sensitive content. The best part? You can add this powerful communication channel to your Next app for free.
In this guide, I'll show you how to integrate with OneSignal in order to add web push notifications to a React app built using the Next.js framework.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have Turbolinks or Turbo in your Rails project, only the first page view would be counted and tracked by Fathom Analytics. Here is how you can make use of load event to track the page views.
For turbolinks:
document.addEventListener("turbolinks:load", function() {
  if (window.fathom) {
    window.fathom.trackPageview()
  }
})

For turbo:
document.addEventListener("turbo:load", function() {
  if (window.fathom) {
    window.fathom.trackPageview()
  }
})

I had recently confirmed the same with Fathom team:
@onerinas

      
@usefathom I'm using Turbolinks and after navigating to another page, it doesn't get updated in the dashboard. After having a look at the script.js, came up with the solution below. Anything else to do other than this?
cc @JackEllis / @pjrvs
@onerinas @JackEllis @pjrvs Because turbolinks runs its own events, this is the way we typically recommend. I don’t think the spa option works with turbolinks. - Jack

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata]]></summary>

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a "pseudo" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
