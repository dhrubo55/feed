          "description": "As Brexit trade negotiations were dragging on at the start of the year, a lot of the discourse was focused on perceived inequities in fishing rights. I felt there was a story in the data that needed to be told. Despite having the largest Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of all EU countries, and some of the richest fishing grounds, UK fleets are restricted to quite modest catches.\nInitially, I had grand plans to create a sort of ‚Äòflow map‚Äô that would trace the translocation of fish from fishing grounds to the country of landing.

Hoisting is a phenomenon in which JavaScript magicallyü§∫ moves the code to the top.\nInterviewer :   \nDev : Sure.
