        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The condition selection is a commonly used in Java to execute a certain code based on the specific condition.
To create an if statement, use this syntax.
if (condition) {
    // code..
}

This is the example of if usage to detect a number is an even or odd number.
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int num = 24;
        if (num % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println("Even number");
        }
    }
}

This is the output:
Even number


Based on the code above, the variable called num is compared using == operator to check if the result of num % 2 (num mod 2) is equals zero. If it is true, the Even number text is printed out.
This is the list of comparation operator that can be used in Java.

Using JS to show and hide something is a web dev rite of passage. Heck, it's the first demo that comes to mind when you think about "state management" (just behind building a counter 😆).
But when you do the classic "hide whenever X variable is false," there's some accessibility concerns you might be forgetting:
can keyboard users still access that hidden element?
do screen readers actually know what your button is trying to show and hide?

In the last post, I talked about react-router setup tutorial. If you don't read the previous post, click it here!. I want to add several important topics about Route Rendering Methods.
There are several ways to render Component or Tag HTML with a <Route>. I used this way in my last post.
<Route path="/">
  <Home />
</Route>

Nothing is wrong with this snippet, and the <Home/> component will be rendered. However, you will not have access to three route props that are match, location, and history. I will talk about these three props in the next post. Stay tuned! So, let's take a look at how we can access those props if we are using these three route rendering methods.

While developing this new printing system, Martin noticed that small changes in the design caused large-scale deployments. In some same cases caused deployments on modules out of the scope of the change. The problem was mainly caused by a large fat interface used throughout all the modules of the system.
The solution given by Robert C. Martin is what we now know as Interface Segregation Principle (ISP). Which is defined as follows:

Jamstack's static nature means that comments don't come natively, but there is no shortage of third party comments providers - Disqus, Commentbox, Facebook Comments, among others. 
The problem is that most of them are either not free, or they have ads and privacy concerns.
