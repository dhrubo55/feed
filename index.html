                    <span>Quick summary


This tutorial will cover the .splice() and .indexOf() array methods and their application in removing a specific item from an array in JavaScript.
It&#x27;s the year 3025. Humanity has finally got out of the solar system and is now exploring new frontiers. Unfortunately, JavaScript still has not got a .remove() method.
Let&#x27;s start with a simple array. The contents or data types inside of it don&#x27;t matter.
const numbers &#x3D; [1, 5, 2, 5, 3, 5]

Now, suppose we need to remove the number 2. Let&#x27;s see how to do that:
const removeItem &#x3D; (arr, val) &#x3D;&gt; {
    const index &#x3D; arr.indexOf(val)
    if (index &gt; -1) {
        arr.splice(index, 1)
    }
    return arr
}

removeItem(numbers, 2)

console.log(numbers)
// [1, 5, 5, 3, 5]

So, as you can see, we have declared a new function called remov‚Ä¶</span>

  My sob story


I am a 44 year old returning student at City College of San Francisco (shout out to my Rams!) who has always wanted to be a software engineer but was discouraged by guidance counselors and others due to the amount of math one needs for a full CS degree. Back in the wild days of the web and just after I finished my Associates Degree in Graphic Design I worked on web-based database applications with Active Server Pages (ASP), HTML, Microsoft Access (!), and an embarrassing number of

                    <span>GitLab commit is just a few days away, and I&#x27;m excited to talk about how to &quot;Upgrade your development workflow with runtime code maps&quot;. Attendance is free; visit https://gitlabcommitvirtual2021.com/ for details. My talk is on Tuesday August 3 at 9:40 AM PDT. I&#x27;ll be around online after the talk to chat and answer questions.
In anticipation of the talk, we&#x27;ve added support for GitLab to AppMap, our open source project which records your code, in your local dev environment, to create and share visual code maps. 
In this brief video, you can see how to:
Record AppMaps in your code editor (VSCode or JetBrains) or with a Chrome browser extension.
View AppMap visual dependency map and execution trace in the code editor.
Upload AppMaps to the AppMap Cloud - a place to store and  share them - logging in with GitLab.
Attach links to AppMaps stored in AppMap Cloud to your GitLab merge requests.
You can use this workflow to find out exactly what code, web services, dependency services, and SQL is used in any use case or test case, and how all that code and data fits together. 
Then you can share AppMaps with your dev team so that they can see exactly what you see. For example, exactly how you spotted and fixed a bug.
Check it out, and I hope to see you at GitLab Commit 2021!</span>

                    <span>From working in the corporate world over several years, I‚Äôve observed that people who speak more and are very vocal about their accomplishments and ideas are thought to be smarter and win the most important projects.
The workplace often punishes people who are introverts and want quiet time. Introverts are often seen as followers, not leaders. More often than not, perception triumphs actual work. I‚Äôve often wondered if it was even possible to succeed as an introvert. In my own case, in many instances, I had let people take credit for my ideas and for my work, as I didn‚Äôt speak up at the right time.

I‚Äôm really curious to see what other people do for these cases, so please share.
I use a simple loading object of true/false flags that I toggle whenever that loading state changes. Messaging, loading indicators, and entire content sections are driven by these flags. 
Even though there are cases where I could use the presence or absence of the relevant data, using a separate object provides the flexibility needed for any design requirement. 
An example:

  
Loading users
    
      ...

First, your going to need to install pygame, a python library used for making games, sound effects and more...
pip3 install pygame
Next, create a python file and put these lines of code at the beginning:
import pygame
pygame.init()
from pygame import mixer

This code first imports the pygame library, initiates it and finally imports mixer from pygame
Before you start using mixer to create sound effects with python, you&#x27;re going to need to put these lines of code first:
running &#x3D; True
if __name__ &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;__main__&quot;:

                    <span>A code that is abstract and reusable is code not tied to unique details of the problem set when writing it. For instance, if you are building an application with core PHP, and have about ten tables in your database, each with its unique set of columns. Imagine having to write insert method for each of these tables, and then update methods for each. That will work but it is tedious and more prone to bugs. 
How about you have a single insert method that when supplied with table name and inputs, viola it inserts the table in the table. Just any table at all-that is to say that this insert method is table agnostic. Behind the scene, this method is a dynamic MySQL query builder. Now, this is abstract and reusable code. This is how frameworks work.

                    <span>Buttons are one of the most common elements in all of UI. It&#x27;ll probably be the first thing you see when you open up a new component library or start working on a new project.
They can be surprisingly complex when you factor in all the different states and implications a button can have when pressed, clicked, or tapped.
Think about these differnt states you need to consider when designing a button:
Full color, outlined, or &quot;ghost&quot; buttons
Loading, disabled, and submitting states
Button sizes like sm, md, and lg
Hover, focus, and active states
Buttons used as links, vs buttons used as... well, buttons
After all is said and done, you can still do more to make sure your button looks &quot;clickable&quot;. Here are a couple ways you can enhance a button.
Overlap content sections


Add animations


Add cursor: pointer




  
  
  1. Overlap content sections


An element that sits on top of 2 sections looks like it almost &quot;floats&quot;, and looks like it could be clicked.

Entrance animations, hover animations, and tap animations can all add to a button in subtle but important ways.
Consider scaling the button or text within it when you hover or click.
It makes a button obviously clickable to have a little finger pop up over a button! Consider adding it to something you know will be clicked.
You can&#x27;t rely on this to signal a button is clickable though for users who navigate without a cursor.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Fauna‚Äôs document streaming feature in a Python application.
Here for the code alone? Head over to the implementation section¬†of this article.
Streaming refers to when a program continuously reads and fetches data from a given source in real-time. For example, while watching a YouTube video or downloading a file from the internet, you stream the data from the origin and process it on your client‚Äôs device instantaneously.
