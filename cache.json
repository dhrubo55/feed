Here are two such constructs and some libraries I've implemented to bring them into JavaScript.\nLove it or hate it, Golang's approach to error handling is simple and straightforward.\nresult, err := someFunc();\nif err != nil {\n  // Handle error\n}\n// Do something with `result`\n\nA place within JavaScript code where this style could particularly shine, is in regards to asynchronous code, where most of the times the following code is written to handle potential errors:\ntry {\n  const result = await someFunc()\n  // Do something with `res‚Ä¶",

This article explains how I went about refactoring the factories to classes.\nIn this scenario we have a Laravel app that allows you to create a post.
