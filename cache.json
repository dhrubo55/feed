          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

Here are five things that I think everybody that writes code should do when they are not coding to keep themselves sharp and to continue learning.\nYes! Talk about code, frameworks, libraries, algorithms, anything that helps you learn more about what you are working on. I think as programmers we often get caught up in the typing of code and lose our skills in other ways to communicate about it. One of the most important skills in our toolset is being able to communicate and explain technology, code, or high level strategy that we are using when solving complex problems. Talking about code helps enforce these skills and even helps us…",

Let me tell you one thing right from the start: Yes, you should!\nWriting as a programmer has a lot of benefits like additional income, personal development, increased reputation, and more. You don’t need to write 10,000 words every month. You don’t even have to write every day. And you definitely don’t need a background in writing or some hidden talent! You just need a reason for writing, and that’s what this article is about.\nReputation\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nYourself\n\n\nPublicity\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nBut the best advice I can give you is to just start writing.

          "description": "Originally posted on my website\nThe popout shadow effect for buttons, inputs, links etc is a popular style.\nSo popular, I even use it as the featured button component on HyperUI: Components for Tailwind CSS.\nBut to create this in Tailwind CSS required additional HTML elements inside which made your HTML cluttered.\nThis is fixed in Tailwind v2.2.\nHere's an example of the old way:\n<a class=\"relative inline-block group\" href=\"\">\n  <span class=\"absolute inset-0 transform translate-x-1 translate-y-1 bg-black group-hover:translate-y-0 group-hover:translate-x-0\"></span>\n  <span class=\"relative inline-block px-8 py-3 bg-white border-2 border-black\"> Hello there! 👋 </span>\n</a>\n\nTailwind Play Example\nThere's 2 additional span tags here and this way makes the shadow effect slightly offset, an example will follow of this will be linked at the bottom!\nThe new and improve way using the new before and after psuedo variants:\n<a href=\"\" class=\"px-8 py-3 bg-white relative border-2 border-black inline-block after:absolute after:inset-0 after:translate-x-1 after:translate-y-1 after:bg-black after:-z-1 hover:after:translate-x-0 hover:after:translate-y-0\">\n  Hello there! 👋\n</a>\n\nBetter, right? The only issue is how long the <a> tag becomes, but that can be fixed with some HTML attribute stacking.\nAnother thing to mention was the use of -z-1 which I had to add to the Tailwind config with the following:\ntheme: {\n  extend: {\n    zIndex: {\n      '-1': '-1',\n    },\n  },\n},\n\nA small addition for much, much cleaner code!\nAs for the slight offset... Here's a replica of the example but in CodePen written with SCSS:\nCodePen Example with SCSS\nIf you compare the old Tailwind way, the new Tailwind v2.2 way and the CodePen SCSS example, you will see the new Tailwind v2.2 way and the CodePen SCSS example match. Whereas the old Tailwind way is slightly offset... Odd.",

Most widely used scenario is when we have form elements and we need to reference these form elements to either print their value or focus these elements etc. \nSo the {useRef} hook is imported from \"react\" like other react hooks and we use them inside functional components to create references and this can be assigned to an html element in the jsx by using the \"ref\" attribute. \nAn example for using the useRef hook is shown below-\nimport React, { useEffect, useRef } from \"react\";\n\nconst UseRefHookExplained = (props) => {\n  // Creating refs for username and password\n  const userNameRef = useRef(null);\n  const passwordRef = useRef(null);\n\n  // We are also creating a reference to the Login button\n  const submitBtnRef = u…",
