        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sprites are a vital part of working on a game in Unity. Part of that is how do you go about slicing a sprite that contains multiple images within it. I’m going to spend some time going through a basic example of how to split a sprite and hook it up to an animation 2D platform game! Let’s get started!




To start you are going to need to acquire a sprite sheet from somewhere. Here is a link to where I acquired the platform character for this project.

Once imported into Unity, you are going to need to splice the sprite. You can do this in a number of ways, but I suggest starting by seeing if Unity can automatically figure out each of the images. To do this, use automatic mode as pictured below.

Once finished, you will see a light grey box around each of the images in the sheet. Hit Apply and let Unity work the magic behind the scenes to cut each image into a usable asset. You will know it is done when you can expand the sheet and see each image appended. Something like this:

At this point, you can start making your animations for your character. In my basic example, this just involved swapping the sprites on each possible state to be the correct image.
Pro tip: Expose lots of variables within your Animator so that it’s easy to tell your player how to move!

And then you’re done! You now have an easy way to control your player in code so that you can make a cool game!
I hope this tip helps! Follow me on twitter for more tech tips!]]></summary>

Lastly but by no means least, carrying on from my previous blog about website security week, we're going to talk about CSP or Content Security Policy.
CSP is Content Security Policy this is one of the most powerful tools in your arsenal to secure your website.
These are two ways to to set your content security policy, either as a header Content-Security-Policy or via a meta tag in your HTML for example:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'none'; img-src https://google.com; child-src 'none';">




The content policy is made up of directives (the thing to restrict) and the value(s) on how it can be restricted. We won't cover all all the possible directives in this blog but you can find a list…]]></summary>

This led to many asking the same question: are there any other AWS Community Builders near me?
The manager of the program, Jason Dunn, agreed to share some anonymized location data with me and I volunteered to draft a quick proof-of-concept map that would display the locations.

It offers a free plan which includes a hosted PostgreSQL database. This can be useful if you're getting started with a new project.
This guide explains how to quickly connect the Postgres database provided by Supabase to a Prisma project. There are other services out there that provide hosted PostgreSQL databases like Heroku or Digital Ocean.
Prisma is an open source next-generation ORM. It consists of the following parts:
Prisma Client: Auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & TypeScript.
Prisma Migrate: Migration system.
Prisma Studio: GUI to view and edit data in your database.

If only you could actually just start. I kept telling myself over and over that I just need to start something and try new things until I find something I like. "Okay cool, what should I start first?" I ask myself. "How about blogging? What about making content on YouTube, or just social media? ..." That all sounds great, but now I'm overwhelmed about what to pick.
Instead of doing development stuff, I'm going to try and make some content around gaming! So I got a camera and made some scenes and spent way to much time setting it all up. By the time I got around to setting up a stream I felt like it was too late, or that my friends didn't actually want to watch my content. When I livestreamed and got a few people watching and interacting it was fun and I enjoyed it, I think. Wh…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scenario:


You encountered a production issue. Immediately you stopped doing whatever you were working on and started fixing the bug. After fixing the bug you observe that you fixed the bug on a different branch. Now you want to move a certain number of commits from a branch A to branch B.
To move a small number of commits from A to B, use the git cherry-pick command
Say, you have the following branches
P ----- Q ----- R ------ S
F ----- G ----- H
(Note: P, Q, R, S, F, G, H are all commit hashes/ids)
and you want to move commits Q & R to B(in front of H). You can do the following by
git checkout branchB
git cherry-pick Q
git cherry-pick R

This will result in
Branch B
F ----- G ----- H ----- Q ----- R
Basically, we first checkout to the branch where we want to add the commits, and cherry-pick the commits we want to move, in the order in which they appear in the first branch. Ensuring that the commits being cherry-picked are in sequential order is important or can result in complications.
Like I said, this method works if the number of commits is small, but to move a large number of commits we can use a better method
git checkout <branchname where commits are to be moved>
git rebase --onto <SHA of most recent commit in branchB> <SHA of the commit before the commit that is to be moved> <SHA of the last commit that is to be moved>
git rebase HEAD <branchname where commits are to be moved>

So, for the above example - moving Q & R to branch B, the commands would be
git checkout branchB
git rebase --onto H P R
git rebase HEAD branchB

These two tricks should be enough for moving commits between branches.

Let’s break those two down and see how they work together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I my previous blog post, I documented how one might proceed to compute the number of digits of an integer quickly. E.g., given the integer 999, you want 3 but given the integer 1000, you want 4. It is effectively the integer logarithm in base 10. On computers, you can quickly compute the integer logarithm … Continue reading Computing the number of digits of an integer even faster]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
