          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

The backend was written with Symfony 2.X and the client was a native android app written in Java.\nLong short story, the backend was a complete headache. I had to deal with different configurations for the server given it was aimed for PHP 7. A lot of deprecations had happened since then so you can picture it. The first setup was good enough, but I ran out of lucky for the 2nd ü§Ø, this led me to create my 100% (almost there) compatible backend.\nVersion 1\nThe android app didn't require too many changes. I basically changed the interfaces, some texts translations and added some validations. Version 1 was a pretty straight forward work.\nUpdate to version 2:\n\nFinally I could achieve the expected behavior and things continue working smoothly. It has been a good experience. Now that I have forked the project every new change is easier to me. I could go deeper with advanced android topics as well. This is a practice I completely recommend to everyone in their spare time.

          "description": "When building an application we often need to serialize objects to JSON for storing them in a key value store (e.g. Redis) or publishing them on a queue.\nWhile there are libraries available like class-transformer or io-ts, there's an easier way to serialize/unserialize objects to JSON.\nclass-transformer depends on the reflect-metadata package. Read this blogpost to know why you should be careful with depending on this package.\nio-ts requires knowledge of some functional programming concepts. While I'm a big fan of functional programming, it's not for everyone. (The library is very well designed though)\nIn both cases we also need to depend on an extra package.\nWe want to keep our dependencies as small as possible.\nWhat none of these packages offer is a way to deal with backwards compatibili‚Ä¶",

So naturally to attract more people and to make your website much more aesthetically beautiful and impressive you can style your text.\nNow which style should you choose?\n1) Gradient Text\n\nGradients add a certain feel to your website that really makes your site stand out. Now changing the background to a gradient is fairly simple and common knowledge. Text Gradients can be slightly trickier but they are totally worth it.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have picked the font and set the size you can start coding your gradient text.\n2) LED-text\n\nThis gives the element an Led-like feel and really helps bring your site to life.\n\n\n\n\nSet the size for your text and select a font. I usually use Brush Script mt for this style as it really adds to the LED theme. Once done set the color(white looks the best). \nThat is all for today. Let me know if you want more text designs.
