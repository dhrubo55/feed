                    <span>My Vue Experience after 3 projects in 18 months


Hello developer pal!, glad to see you here.
In this post, I&#x27;ll share my experience after 3 projects written/maintained in Vue 2.* during the last 18 months.
The topics to be focused on are:
Agile Methodology and frameworks used
Design Systems
Infrastructure
Backend
State Management
Frontend
Disclaimer: This post comes from my own experience during this lapse, not saying this is the best way to go, nor the worst, any contribution is more than welcome in the threads below!
Are you familiar with Agile Software Development?, cause I really am right now!, I really like this simple sentence as a summary:

Swift Concurrency Support
Concurrency enables your apps to perform multiple tasks at the same time, which helps your apps stay responsive to user input while doing work in the background, like a weather app fetching forecast data while the user selects a city.



The problem? Swift never had native support for concurrent code, so it was unnecessarily difficult to write good concurrent code. Apple’s new approach to this is Structured Concurrency. Actors are an industry standard and are vital to safe concurrent programming.

                    <span>Recently I followed along a &#x27;Build A Todo App With REACT&#x27; tutorial by Dev Ed on YouTube. I wanted to review and write about what I learned, as this is a new technique I would like to add into my habits.
Note: this is an ongoing draft and is currently only 1/3 done. If you would like to get straight to the tutorial, just click above. Otherwise, enjoy what I have reviewed thus far!
Obligatory Spoiler Alert The tutorial was amazing. You create a Todo list. It&#x27;s not perfectly mobile responsive. Some of the concepts you will learn about by following this tutorial include Component building, Properties (prop) drilling, State managing and storing through the localStorage object.

You will create a working example application and manually implement application-layer sharding. It shows how to choose a shard key based on the use-cases and data model. This helps to apply the same principles to DBMS with integrated scaling like MongoDB, etc.

                    <span>Async await is another way of handling promises in JavaScript.
In this article we will understand with examples and use cases.
In general, we use .then().catch() to handle promises:
const url &#x3D;&quot;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1&quot;;

fetch(url)
  .then(response&#x3D;&gt;response.json())
  .then(data&#x3D;&gt;console.log(data))
  .catch(error&#x3D;&gt;console.log(error));

Let&#x27;s handle it using async await
We can write using function statement or function expression. Both will be valid, only difference is use of anonymous function in function expression.
//function statement
    async function getPosts(){
        const response &#x3D; await fetch(url);
        const data &#x3D; await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    }

I was hired as a freelance web developer to work on a finance online app. Note: I had never used laravel before and had never done a FullStack job before, but I used it and completed the lengthy and complex job in a month without receiving a single complaint from the client. Without realizing it, I learned a lot and was able to solve problems in laravel, as well as answer most interview questions about this framework.

                    <span>Center aligning items has being a much-discussed topic in CSS. Beginners and sometimes professionals often find themselves googling this topic when they get stuck while trying to center align texts or elements in CSS.
From my experience, center aligning has never been a problem to me since I saw a cheat in a YouTube video.
Now don&#x27;t be quick to go to YouTube to search &quot;cheat in aligning items to the center&quot;.
You are not going to find what I found that way. I found these cheat between the lines of this video. The YouTuber may probably not recall they mentioned something like that.
From this video, I discovered that center aligning items in CSS depends plainly on the

Before getting started, I am going to use arrow function and  in case you don&#x27;t know arrow functions don&#x27;t worry, I have used normal functions (ES5 syntax) also!
This blog includes →
For Each

This is a simple for loop.

Now let&#x27;s try this same thing using for Each loop.

For each helps you to reduce the lines of code and makes the code much more readable.

The first parameter is the variable in which all the values are stored one by one, and the second parameter is the index of the 
As the name suggests, .filter() is a method which helps us to 
The .filter() method creates a new array with the values which is falling under the given condition from the existing array.

.map() method creates a new array and performs a particular function for each element in the array.

As the name suggests .sort() method helps us to sort the array according to our condition.
If we want to sort the companies according to their start years.

.sort() also makes a new array and the original array is un-touched.
.reduce() method reduces the whole array to a single value.

We have to give 0 to set the initial value from which the values will start although it is optional so you may skip it.
This is a bonus array method for y&#x27;all!
This method checks if the entered value is in the array or not.
Note: idexOf() is cases sensitive.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.

                    <span>Most computer chips today in flagship phones and computers use a process based on a 5 nm or larger resolution. Finer resolutions usually translate into lower energy usage and lower heat production. Given that many of our systems are limited by heat or power, finer resolutions lead to higher performance. The large Taiwanese chip maker … Continue reading Science and Technology links (May 22nd 2021)</span>

                    <span>Suppose that you give me two ASCII strings having the same number of characters. I wish to compute efficiently the number of matching characters (same position, same character). E.g., the strings ‘012c’ and ‘021c’ have two matching characters (‘0’ and ‘c’). The conventional approach in C would look as follow: uint64_t standard_matching_bytes(char * c1, char … Continue reading Counting the number of matching characters in two ASCII strings</span>
