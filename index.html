                    <span>There are few fields in JavaScript that provide an equal amount of possible solutions and tools to the handling of asynchronous code. There is a reason for the existence  of the vast amount of tools. Handling asynchronous code in a readable and manageable way has always been challenging in JavaScript. We are going to try to understand callbacks, promises, generators and async await so as to know when to use each tool and how they actually differ.
Callbacks are the oldest and simplest way to deal with asynchronous code in JavaScript. Callbacks are also known as higher order functions. They functions passed into functions and they are executed at some point. let us have a look at an example code
let x &#x3D; function () {
    console.log(&quot;i am called from inside a function&quot;);

When getting started with Docker, many developers quickly turn to Docker Compose to run their applications. Compose offers many advantages, such as having your configuration stored as code, making it easy to maintain and expand upon. Unfortunately, although it is possible to use Compose with Kubernetes, it&#x27;s not the recommended approach.
Devs will often bang their head against the wall trying to make this scenario work when they start using Kubernetes, without knowing that there&#x27;s a better way. After all, they have become used to Compose and have integrated it deeply into their workflow. It can be hard to let go.
This article will go over why it&#x27;s best to leave Compose out of Kubernetes, and give resources to help you with improving your workflow without it. You&#x27;ll be introd…</span>

                    <span>Ive been working on my first &quot;React&quot; project and this project I build is a &quot;Park Browser&quot; which is basically an app that helps you search for a specific national park in USA either by address, city or state.

It was really hard to understand how can I filter through an array with multiple conditions and also pass those conditions from a child component to parent.

Parent:

Child:

It seemed like its working but there was another problem,

It is pretty simple what the &quot;continue&quot; method does,
It helped me a-lot with understanding how to pass data from child to parent and how to use multiple conditions to filter and array.
I hope this post helped you with your errors,
Good Luck!</span>

                    <span>Recently, I visited a website and while surfing through it, the website’s chatbot caught my attention. I had been looking for a new project to work on, so I got to researching how I could build a chatbot using vanilla JavaScript. While building this project from scratch I stumbled across a lot of difficulties based on the knowledge I had and when I say &#x27;from scratch&#x27;, I just mean I did not use any additional libraries or APIs while building. Part of this code is based on existing blog posts, articles, and YouTube videos. Also note that this project is more of an insight into JavaScript fundamentals, not any form of artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning. The main prerequisite for understanding this article is the knowledge of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

                    <span>I am a front-end engineer who mostly works on a Bigcommerce platform. Bigcommerce uses a handlebar with the &#x27;stencil command line interface&#x27; and it requires &#x27;node version manager&#x27; (nvm).
I switched my Intel Macbook Pro with M1 Chip Macbook Pro then I couldn&#x27;t realize this migration will be a little bit ticky.
I installed homebrew then node and nvm packages then I followed the steps on bigcommerce developer website. 
However, almost every project gives different errors but all of them are related to the &#x27;node&#x27; version. I&#x27;ve gotten few-hour research on Google but these were not about BigCommerce &#x27;stencil-cli&#x27;,

                    <span>I wish the details element would support different labels (provided by the summary tag) for its open and closed states.
Consider a label of &quot;Closed, click to open&quot; when the details element is closed and &quot;Open, click to close&quot; when open:

Sadly only one summary tag is supported by the details element. However you can use an empty summary with a ::before pseudo-element to implement this.
Save the following to a file:

  
  
    #widget1 div { padding-inline-start: 1em; max-width: 20em;}
    #widget1 summary::before { content: &quot;Closed, click to open&quot;;}
    #widget1[open] summary::before { content: &quot;Open, click to close&quot;;}
    #widget1[open] summary { height: 2em;}
  

  
 Text before details.

    
Text after details.
  


to experiment.
Note that it might not be accessible. I didn&#x27;t try to see if adding a live region aria label to the summary would cause the label change to be announced. I suspect it will not, but refining this is left as an exercise for the reader. Add your experimental findings to the comments below.</span>

We go to start with Predicate Interface, this interface is an interface functional a little different from Consumer Interface that receives a parameter and does not return anything. The Predicate interface receives a parameter and returns a value boolean. The function that an interface receives is primarily some comparison that can have with returns a boolean.
see an example:
List numbers &#x3D; Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10);


numbers.stream().filter((c) -&gt; (c % 2) &#x3D;&#x3D; 0)

I’ll also show you how to safely store customer card details so that they don’t have to be manually re-entered or re-swiped for future transactions.
In payment industry terms, this capability is known as Card on File, or CoF for short. For frequent transactions, e.g. ordering a Lyft or a Lime, having a card stored makes for a much snappier, lower-friction in-app user experience. Entering card details every time would be very tedious.

As a security-minded developer, I know you might be wondering: Is it safe to store a user’s credit card details? Is this even legal?

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>
