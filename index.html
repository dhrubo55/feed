                    <span>You often forget that APIs exist for most of the platforms you use. While some companies lock down their APIs to only provide very limited information, DEV.to goes the extra mile to provide an extremely robust API. Let’s go over what is available!




Link to Project: https://www.josephamaurer.com/Projects/DevAPI/RecentDevPosts.html 
Link to DEV API Documentation: https://docs.forem.com/api/ 
DEV’s API allows for lots of interesting functionality. In the video above, I go over a use case where you pull the latest 100 posts, and create bootstrap cards for each. In each card I display three buttons. The first is either active or disabled if the user has a twitter account. This is useful because I like to retweet articles and tag their creators. The second button is a link to the DEV post. Finally the third button opens the API response for the article.
While my example showed articles, there are lots of different things that the API can return to you. One of the more interesting functionality is the ability to post an article completely from the API. I have no idea why you would want to do that, but it could be useful. 
All in all, it’s cool to think that this functionality exists, even if you can’t find a practical use case for it. One of the more useful use cases might just be populating your recent articles from your blog to your website. 
Let me know what you would want to do with this API!</span>

                    <span>Web push notifications are a way of informing your app users when something important has happened. 
Users can receive web push notifications even when they are not actively using your application, for instance, if the app is open in a background tab or even if it&#x27;s not open. 

Push notifications are widely supported by all browsers except for Safari: 78% of web users use a browser that supports them.
In this tutorial, I&#x27;ll show you how to subscribe to notifications in the browser and how to send notifications from a Java server. 





  
  
  A bit of background: how web push notifications work


Web push notifications rely on two web standards: Notification API and Push API (which in turn uses ServiceWorker). They require HTTPS to work.

                    <span>When building Microservices the de facto way to do it is to use both HTTP, as the protocol, and REST, as the way to represent resources. HTTP is literally the foundation of the World Wide Web and it is supported by multiple programmings in one way or another, so using HTTP is a no brainer because it could be used by any Frontend and Backend code with few to no external dependencies.
REST is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer coined by Roy Fielding and introduced in his doctoral dissertation, it is an architectural style that defines guidelines when building web services, it&#x27;s not a standard but it does use standards like HTTP (and its verbs to represent actions) and payload/message formats (like JSON or XML), to mention a few.

As developers, the ability to collaborate through videos (for example, pair programming, demos, etc.) is an extremely important part of a software workflow, especially for communities and teams that are distributed.
GitHub video support is now finally GA, so let&#x27;s see how it works

                    <span>Next.js is a framework for building React web applications, super-fast static websites, and single-page JavaScript applications. It was designed to help solve common problems associated with React development, including production optimizations such as code splitting, code bundlers (webpack), and code compilers (Babel).
Next.js is also gaining popularity for its superior developer experience and many built-in features, notably automatic code splitting for faster page loading and client-side routing with optimized prefetching. 
On 28 April 2021, the Next.js team announced the release of Next.js 10.2 with even more attractive new features. The new release enables developers to build hybrid applications containing both server-rendered and statically generated pages.

                    <span>O objetivo deste artigo é falar sobre o Ciclo de Vida do Request no framework web para a Linguagem de Programação Elixir chamado Phoenix. Esse assunto é introdutório para começarmos a aprender o framework, onde criaremos duas páginas ao longo do nosso projeto.
Como base para este guia, foram retirados alguns trechos da documentação oficial do Phoenix, e de algumas ideias do bootcamp da Rocketseat.
Primeiramente, vamos criar o projeto rodando o comando abaixo:
$ mix phx.new hello_phoenix --no-ecto

Note que usamos um underline para separar o nome hello_phoenix. Essa separação chamada de snake case é uma convenção da comunidade Elixir, usada bastante também para nomear arquivos. Com o underline, nossa aplicação vai conseguir converter o nome hello_phoenix para HelloPhoenix em nomes de módulo…</span>

                    <span>Currently I need to deploy my application to  platform.sh but could find a good example for the template for a vue - grid some application so here it is:


The application that I&#x27;m currently using for this test is this
mendozaRoofing
Mendoza roofing Wilmington NC &lt;- Host in Netlify currently
For the .platform.app.yaml file I have the fallowing configuration
# .platform.app.yaml

# The name of this application, which must be unique within a project.
name: &quot;vuejs&quot;

# The type key specifies the language and version for your application.
type: &quot;nodejs:14&quot;

build:
  flavor: none

# Build dependencies.
dependencies:
  nodejs:
    &quot;@gridsome/cli&quot;: &quot;*&quot;

# The hooks that will be triggered when the package is deployed.
hooks:
  # Build hooks can modify the application files on disk but not access any services like databases.
  build: |
    npm i
    gridsome build
# The size of the persistent disk of the application (in MB).
disk: 5120

# The configuration of the application when it is exposed to the web.

      # The public directory of the application relative to its root.
      root: &quot;dist&quot; #The build directory if you have a custom output directory then you should change it
      index: [&quot;index.html&quot;]
      scripts: false
      allow: true


.platform folder


For the router.yaml file that should go in the .platform directory
# Each route describes how an incoming URL is going to be processed by Platform.sh.
&quot;https://www.{default}/&quot;:
  type: upstream
  upstream: &quot;vuejs:http&quot;
#Remember the the name in the .platform.app.yaml  should be the same for the name before the :http

&quot;https://{default}/&quot;:
  type: redirect
  to: &quot;https://www.{default}/&quot;


For the services.yaml file that should go in the .platform directory
Currently, I have this file empty because is just a static site.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.

                    <span>The division instruction is one of the most expensive instruction in your CPU. Thus optimizing compilers often compile divisions by known constants down to a multiplication followed by a shift. However, in some lucky cases, the compiler does not even need a shift. I call the corresponding divisors ideal. For the math. geeks, they are … Continue reading Ideal divisors: when a division compiles down to just a multiplication</span>
