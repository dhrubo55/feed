If you want to manually post and schedule social media to networks like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, or YouTube, there are some excellent web-based posting tools out there. However, if you run an app or platform, say for example a CMS that allows user to create content, your users typically want a simple process to post to social media networks without having to download the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[** What you need ? **



Dockerhub and Github Account
Server with linux setup. For this case ubuntu
Your application is already need to be configured on your test instances
*This tutorial assumes you have set up a Jenkins file in your project. View reference make necessary changes
*sudo apt update
search of all available packages & pick one from the options
For this case I will be using version 11, so 
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
Confirm installation with running version check
java -version
Now we are ready to install Jenkins. We start off by appending the Debian package repository address to the server's sources.list
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add - sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > \


We'll run update so that apt will use the new repo
sudo apt-get update
Installing Jenkins
sudo apt-get install jenkins=2.289.3
That's all 
Login into your Github, and head over to your developer settings : Profile -> Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens
Note: I wouldn't consider this optional but it's good practice to set an expiration duration for your token.
Select admin:repo_hook

Lastly set repo: repo_status. Jenkins likes to access the repo commit status 
Click "Generate token" and save your token somewhere.
1.SSH in your Jenkins instance
sudo "cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword"
your-instance-ip:8080
1.Log into Jenkins
3.Set up docker hub credentials: 
4.Set up global properties in Jenkins for staging server
5.Set up Jenkins project
Under branch sources: click add source -> GitHub 
Select github_key for credentials
Jenkins will scan your repo and run an initial build
In Jenkins, In the project- click “ master “ -> click. “ Build now ”

But I will tell you one thing. It literally takes no time everyday to take care of your spine and overall health with little or no efforts. Because, you accept or not everyone suffers from back pain.
Here are my personal favorite habits that I follow to keep a check on my health.

After some much wondering on the internet trying to find a helping hand on my journey on the ongoing HNG internship, I came across KODECAMP I immediately hop into their Bootcamp as it is running the same time with the HNGI8 internship, you know it's a bonus for me as I will be learning and at same participating on the on going internship.
Why I Joined KODECAMP BootCamp.
Master my act in Frontend development.


Be able to take on any project that was thrown my way with fear. 


I have been battling impostor syndrome, by the expiration of the 16 weeks, impostor syndrome is no longer part of me. 


It will give the right focus during the ongoing internship as I will be standing on their training to tackle all the tasks thrown my way during the HNGi8 internship. 



The truth is that by the end of the internship and this current Bootcamp I'm jumping into a job as a web developer majoring mainly on the frontend stack using REACT. .

I am David Edu, certified in Data analytics/Business Intelligence, presently pursuing a career in decision making using Data science. I'm fascinated about the application of machine learning in solving real life problems and Artificial intelligence in general. My hobbies include Coding, reading, gaming, and networking.
Front-End
I am currently undergoing a web Front-End training course with KodeCamp. KodeCamp is a tech training platform that provides training tracks in web Front-End dev, Back-End dev and UI/UX designs. The training is designed to last for 12 weeks and during this time my goals are to:
Advance my html and css skills
Get hands on experience by applying my skills on real life 
projects.
Networking with industry experts and fellow tech enthusiasts.
Building up my digital portfolio.
