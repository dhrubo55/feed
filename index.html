                    <span>Hi, in this is part 3 of the tree data structure, we&#x27;re going to discuss the Binary search tree, and in the next post, we will cover in detail its implementation (insertion, searching, and deletion).
Binary search tree: or (sorted binary tree) is a binary tree invented in (1960) which all nodes that exist in the right sub-tree are greater than the nodes that exist in the left sub-tree and there parent node.
and Both the left and right subtrees must be binary search trees as well.

The space complexity of the binary search tree is O(n) where n is the number of elements.




insert
search
delete




best case
O(log n)
O(log n)
O(log n)


worst case
O(n)
O(n)
O(n)



The time complexity of the Binary search tree becomes O(n) if the binary tree is a skewed binary tree.
Faster than array and Linked list in insertion and deletion.
It is so Efficient in searching
getting The minimum and the Maximum easily
More stack space due to the recursion 
The run time mat increases because of the comparisons.

When building docker images, it is oftentimes enough to use normal commands to start the container.

CMD [&quot;echo&quot;, &quot;Hello, world!&quot;]

Occasionally, an additional entry point is used. When written like this, it is mostly for convenience, but there are some elaborate use cases.
FROM alpine
ENTRYPOINT [&quot;echo&quot;]
CMD [&quot;Hello, world!&quot;]

Sometimes, we really need to do more work or operate on environment variables, which can be tricky due to the difference in shell and exec syntax in the Dockerfile. In that case, a script commonly called entrypoin…</span>

                    <span>What is Destructuring?



The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values 
In this post we will discuss how destructuring works on both objects and arrays in JavaScript.
With destructuring we can read a property and assign its value to a variable without duplicating the property name. More than that, we can read multiple properties from the same object in just one statement. This is very useful especially when we are dealing with large or nested arrays and objects. 
At the end of the day destructuring is a syntactic sugar that
In the example below we create the object person that contains the fields name and age. Now let&#x27;s say that we want to extract these properties from the object.
const person &#x3D; {
    name: &#x27;Alex&#x27;,
    age: &#x27;22&#x27;,
};…</span>

So long back, I was working on a game that added 1 point to the user&#x27;s score for every correct answer and deducted 0.1 points for a wrong one. The game starts with 1 point in your balance and then the score gets calculated based on your choices. Prima facie it worked fine (kind of) but then something caught me by dismay.

Nowadays, managing state is the most crucial part in any application&#x27;s architecture. Most applications behaviour depends on the values of states defined in them, So understanding how to manage it efficiently becomes very important. Before hooks introduction in React version 16.8, the only way to use state in your application is through class component. But now with the help of useState hook we can manage state in our functional components too. So, in this article we will be learning everything that we need to know about useState to get started with stateful functional components.
Lets start by understanding the use of useState hook by looking at an example of a simple counter application writt…</span>

To see this in action you need to like and retweet the below tweet (It will take a minute to reflect the changes in the profile name)

Javascript provides a global object called console which gives us the ability to access the browser&#x27;s debugging console. If you have ever worked with javascript you must have used it with its log property. But it is not limited to that, try running the below command
console.log(console);

You will see the capabilities that this console object comes with.

Let&#x27;s take a look at some useful ones:
This is the most commonly used property. It is used to print out anything to the web console that we put inside of log().
console.log(&#x27;foo&#x27;);
console.log(10);
console.log(null);
console.log(undefined);
console.log([&#x27;foo&#x27;, &#x27;bar&#x27;]);
console.log({ foo: &#x27;hello&#x27;, bar: &#x27;hi&#x27; });

                    <span>Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed 📺 Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>
