They're pivotal to cloud storage services and allow web applications of massive scale to stay reactive. As programmers build these systems, they need fundamental building blocks they can use as a starting point and to communicate in a shared vocabulary.
This is where distributed system design patterns become invaluable. While sometimes overused, design patterns are a key skill recruiters are looking for and are essential to stand out in advanced system design interviews.
Today, we'll explore 5 of the top distributed system design patterns to help you learn their advantages, disadvantages, and when to use them.

The simplest of the 4 hooks I'm going to explain in this article. useState allows you to have a state variable in functional component. If you're confused, it's just a normal variable which can make a component re-render when the value of the variable is changed. For example:
import { useState } from "react";

Nearly everyone touching cloud infrastructure in 2021 is familiar with the Kubernetes project. Put simply, Kubernetes is an incredibly powerful platform for container orchestration. But in my opinion, Kubernetes, more than anything, is a collection of best practices baked into a system that can scale from a Raspberry Pi up to the largest Fortune 500 infrastructure. It empowers developers and operators alike to collaborate through standardized APIs and meaningful abstractions (like a Pod or a ConfigMap).

I don't remember arriving at the car park, only the birthing suite, I burst in to the entrance... The lady said. "Mother and baby haven't been very well, I will take you through in a moment".
I remember the feeling, then thinking, oh god I have lost them, We walked into the hospital together laughing and I will be leaving on my own...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
