          "description": "An Array is a data type in JavaScript used for storing a collection of like data. In our daily activities, we always find ourselves grouping things that are alike together, sometimes we even find ourselves being grouped with people that we share a common function or attribute.\nAn array is how we can represent this group together in javascript. Different names can be used to mean an array, some are collection, group, list, etc. But with the names, I believe you can get an idea of what Javascript array is all about.\nSay we have a list (array, group, collection) of all the student's names of a class, we could represent this in JavaScript thus\nconst studentNames = [\n  'Dwayne Johnson',\n  'Lionel Messi',\n  'Kevin Hart',\n  'Elon Musk',\n  'Lebron James',\n];\n\nThe array studentNames represents the ‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Beside functions being first class citizens in JavaScript, there are plenty of other features, allowing functions to make an extra mile ride. Closures are one of them. \nA closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment)\nMozilla \nLet's take an example:\nfunction adder(a) {\n  return function(b) {\n    return a + b;\n  };\n}\n\nlet add5 = adder(5);\nlet add10 = adder(10);\n\nconsole.log(add5(2));  // 7\nconsole.log(add10(2)); // 12\n\nFrom above code, it's clear how closures work, and how it remembers the lexical scope, the function was declared within. But how this could be useful, or is it just non-practical questions in JavaScript interviews? \nDon't worry, we have got plenty of applications and usage, of Closures th‚Ä¶",
