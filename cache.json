          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

On average, an app will take about 7-9 months to build and cost you about $270,000. That’s an unrealistic number for some businesses.\nYour company may not even be able to secure a $200,000 line of credit, never mind pay over $250,000 for an app.\nSo what’s the solution?\nThere are some great resources online that teach you how to code for free. I’ll show you my favourite ones. Team Treehouse offers a free trial for a week to new users. So you can learn to code from your computer, anywhere with a Wi-Fi connection.\nHere’s how their system works. They have thousands of videos to teach users the basics of coding. After you watch the videos, you’ll take quizzes to test your knowledge. \n\nCode Academy is another one of my favourites.\n\nFor small business who are just interested in converting their existing website to a mobile app, they can take advantage of the \"Krowser Web Services App Development Support Program\" \nYou just need to submit your business website link and an android app will be developed and published on the Google Play Store all for free.\nThe whole process typically takes 7 days.\nSubmit your website here: https://forms.gle/jExGTmyvv2hgFcfF7\nCreating an android app for your business is much easier than it sounds.\nDepending on your situation, you’ve got lots of options to choose from.",

          "description": "I remember reading many times over this piece of advice given to new, aspiring developers : « Go ahead! Read some source code, then contribute to open source projects!  ». Truth be told, hearing this right after attending a 2-month coding bootcamp kind of felt like being pushed to try and climb a mountain with slippers and a swimsuit.\nIn spite of this, barely three years forward and a few apps later, a good friend of mine and I just released our very first Ruby gem, abyme. From the moment we rolled up our sleeves, up to our first release on rubygems, we just learnt so much along the way we felt we ought to share this experience, in the hope of empowering others to do the same.\nBefore we dive in, let's quickly review a few reasons as to why we think building a gem is good for everyone - inc…",

          "description": "Context\n\n\nWhile NextJS is a powerful tool in its own right, adding Express to it makes for a really powerful combo.\nYou may want to add a custom API to your application without spinning up a separate API service, or you may want to take control of routing, or run some middleware and fetch standard data for your pages before they are served. Perhaps you have an existing API server and you wish to enable it to serve some front end.\nThis type of set up is documented in NextJS itself: https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server\nIn the standard example, they use Node's http package; we'll use Express to take advantage of its middleware and routing capabilities.\nI've provided an example barebones integration at https://github.com/alexey-dc/nextjs_express_template\nLet's take a look at…",
