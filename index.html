                    <span>Questions to answer:
What problems does Docker solve?
What are containers?
What is the difference between a container and a VM?
What is the difference between images and containers?
How does Docker help create applications?
Why Docker?
The need for Docker arises from virtual machines on servers being used at large scales. Take a large business for example. For a business that uses hundreds of servers with a cluster of virtual machines for each of their platforms, maintaining these machines is a full-time job. Each server has to have an OS installed, it needs upgrades and patches from time to time, and then dependencies for the applications each machine uses also have to be installed. 
You can see why this quickly becomes very complex. Manually configuring these servers is not feasible, so …</span>

As usual, if you are a visual learner, or simply prefer to watch and listen instead of reading, here you have the video with the whole explanation and demo, which to be fair is much more complete than this post.

Let&#x27;s start with what the GITHUB_TOKEN is in GitHub Actions and how it works.
The GITHUB_TOKEN is a special access token that you can use to authenticate on behalf of GitHub Actions. GitHub automatically creates a GITHUB_TOKEN secret for you to use in your workflow, and you can us…</span>

in this type of representation, we use 2-dimensional arrays to represent the graph where the number of columns and rows is the total number of vertices. 
if A[i][j] &#x3D; 1  that means i and j are adjacent. 
Fast to lookup and check for presence or absence of a specific edge between any two nodes O(1)

Fast to add a new edge O(1)

Slow to iterate over all edges
Slow to add or delete a node O(n2)
The space complexity of adjacency matrix is O(n2)

In this tutorial we will talk about Higher-Order Components (HOC), a widely used react concept and a topic that is commonly discussed in front-end developer interviews. We will discuss what they are and how to write them.
You may have heard about the don’t-repeat-yourself (DRY) programming principle, where we look to reduce the amount of duplicate logic on our applications.
Well, this principle has evolved as a pattern that you can see on higher-order functions on JavaScript, or as Higher-Order Components in React.
Let’s first understand what are higher-order functions, since I think you may have been using them a lot without knowing their higher-order nature.
A higher-order function is a function that takes a function as a parameter, returns another function, or both.

                    <span>Cryptography is the backbone of distributed ledger technologies like blockchain and other consensus-oriented distributed networks. If you are interested in building decentralized applications, it&#x27;s essential to understand the wallet generation and transaction signing processes. Both of which rely heavily on underlying cryptographic protocols.
In addition to distributed networks, cryptography is a critical component of cybersecurity. With cybercrime on the rise and cyberattacks costing businesses an average of 2.3 Million dollars per malware attack source, it is increasingly important to have your cybersecurity up to par. With the proper use of cryptography, you could save your business big time by ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive information.

                    <span>Intro


This is how I built a photo booth application with AWS Serverless services.
Once user capture an image and provide an email, background of the image is removed and new background applied and watermark with timestamp will be added. Then the image will be emailed to the given email address.
Below tools and technologies are used to built this.
Backend:
AWS Lambda with runtime Node.js
Step Function
S3
SES
remove.bg API
Frontend:
VueJS
vue-web-cam plugin
Hosted on Amplify web hosting



IAC:
Serverless Framework

In the frontend VueJS app (hosted in Amplify), first a image will be captured with the email address. 


Then the app will request for pre-signed url.


Captured image will be uploaded to S3 with the pre-signed url and the email address as a meta data.

                    <span>To run an effective stand-up meeting with a remote team, follow these simple steps to focus your team’s attention, keep the meeting moving, and provide the most value for everyone involved:
Use a standard set of Q and As
Keep it short
Have a solid A/V setup
Make sure everyone participates
Share updates
Account for time zone differences
Don’t have one!
Regardless of whether your team is remote/distributed or co-located, the best stand-up, or scrum, meetings consist of team members answering a standard set of questions and answers. Consistent questions help people prepare as they know in advance what information they’re expected to share.
This helps keep the stand-up both efficient and short (more on that later). We think the traditional scrum questions are very effective, but you can adjust…</span>

People have started creating star rating systems that don&#x27;t use stars or anything even resembling a star, people are making inaccessible rating systems (the very thing I was rallying against - and @lapstjup
 is certainly not alone!), some are even making star rating systems that don&#x27;t work on 20%+ of browsers.

Then it hit me... why shouldn&#x27;t I create the next Facebook of password storage?
1. The app must have a generous free tier. I wanted a personal plan, where you can store your passwords safely across multiple devices without hassle.
2. The app must feel new and responsive. When I used Lastpass and Bitwarden I felt like I was using a slightly outdated piece of software. I think the best and easiest way to achieve this is by

  Declare correct Doctype

If correct Doctype  is not declared new HTML5-specific tags will not interpreted by the browser.

###Write w3c valid markup
Use validator like w3c validator to check your markup and write error free more structured code. Validator  will suggest you some best practice of  HTML5 coding standard. I strongly recommend you to valid your code by w3c validator.

                    <span>Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed 📺 Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>
