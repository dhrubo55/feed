Unfortunately, the security threats are also on the rise and it has become easier for hackers to sell the credentials on the dark web or publish breached data on paste sites, hijack social media accounts for click baiting or fund transactions.

                    <span>One of the biggest mistakes we can see when optimizing existing code is the absence of the debounce function.  When we use Javascript for our web applications or even frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, a debounce function is essential to ensuring a given task does not fire so often that it bricks the browser performance.
Bouncing is the tendency of any two metal contacts in an electronic device to generate multiple signals as the contacts close or open; debouncing is any kind of hardware device or software that ensures that only a single signal will be acted upon for a single opening or closing of a contact.
For example, when you press a key on your computer keyboard, you expect a single contact to be recorded by your computer. In fact, however, there is initial contact, a slight bou…</span>

                    <span>Tldr; (What is the series about)


This post is an introductory post to a series that will describe my journey to analyze and learn how the keyboard backlight driver on my laptop works, and then re-implement it on my own. I wanted a place to dump my thoughts and different things I try, and learn in the process. 
I recently upgraded to a new laptop (HP Omen 15-en0037AX). The laptop has a four-zone RGB LED backlight on the keyboard. Like most laptops that ship with such a keyboard, the manufacturer shipped a preinstalled app (Omen Light Studio) on windows to customize the various lighting modes on the keyboard. 

HP Omen Light Studio
  
Unfortunately, this app is only available for Windows, which is a problem, as I am primarily a Linux user.
Since I have always been interested in cybersecurity and have taken part in multiple CTF (Capture the Flag) events, I have a basic understanding of how to Reverse Engineer C/C++ binaries using tools like Ghidra but have never reversed an actual real-life application. In this series I want to (hopefully) achieve two things:
Reverse Engineer the Omen Light Studio App, and figure out how it interfaces with the hardware on the laptop to control the keyboard&#x27;s lighting.
Re implementing the functionality on Linux (maybe in C/C++/Python/NodeJS) and possibly make a similar desktop app.
This series is going to be me documenting all my approaches (right or wrong), and also explaining various concepts I learned in the process. Currently, I have no idea where this will lead to or what tools/languages I need to know/learn, but all that begins from the next post. See you there!</span>

                    <span>In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar&#x27;s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar&#x27;s code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.[1]
The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigenère cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern pract…</span>

                    <span>What is a Dockerfile?


Dockerfile is a text document containing commands which can be run in sequence to assemble a docker image.
A sample Dockerfile from the official docs looks like this
# syntax&#x3D;docker/dockerfile:1
FROM node:12-alpine
RUN apk add --no-cache python g++ make
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN yarn install --production
CMD [&quot;node&quot;, &quot;src/index.js&quot;]

There are millions of images on dockerhub that we can directly start using with a command like this.
docker run -it --rm -d -p 8080:80 --name web nginx

For various reasons, we may want to customize these base images. Docker images are immutable, so we can&#x27;t exactly modify them.
