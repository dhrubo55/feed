                    <span>Lazy-loading is the simple process of loading resources only when they are needed. These resources can be anything, from images to stylesheets, fonts, scripts, iframes etc.
We&#x27;re going to use the package called, &quot;Lozad.&quot; To lazy-load images. Lozad. will only add 1 KB to your production üì¶! Check out Bundlephobia  üò± for more info.
We&#x27;re only going to lazy-load images but Lozad can handle lazy-loading for srcsets, background images, videos and iframes too. So, let&#x27;s include the package and start hacking! ü™ì
npm i lozad

Include Lozad in your entry or main JavaScript file. Alternatively, you could use Lozad CDN if you don&#x27;t have module bundler set up.
import lozad from &#x27;lozad&#x27;;

// Make sure to run the library only when all DOM elements are available.
document.addEventListener(&#x27;DOMContentLoaded&#x27;, () &#x3D;&gt; {
   /**
   * This is all you need to do!
   * Check the link for advanced usages.
   * https://www.npmjs.com/package/lozad
   */
   lozad().observe();
});

By default, Lozad will look for images with class, &quot;lozad,&quot; and the attribute of &quot;data-src&quot;. When the image is about to enter the viewport, Lozad takes the data-src attribute and assigns it to to the src attribute to load the image.


That&#x27;s it, you&#x27;ve successfully added support for lazy-loading üéâüß®üéä!
Best practice would be to leave the images that are in the header and lazy-load only the ones that are below the initial viewport.
Use Lozad to lazy-load a background image and video!
Please, share your thoughts and experiences as to how lazy-loading improved your website. PS, are you guys interested in me writing about lazy-loading using vanilla JavaScript? Let me know in the comments, thank you!</span>

Ux means user experience. The Ux designer&#x27;s job is to bring awesome and meaningful experiences to users.
It does not mean everything must be simplistic and trivial.
Of course, Ux and intuitiveness are not enemies at all. They are not mutually exclusive, but they are not exactly the same idea. That&#x27;s why I did not say &quot;Ux vs. intuitiveness&quot;. While intuitiveness is essential, it should not be the ultimate goal at all costs.

I really like the interactions that it creates between team members and working together on a certain task. Having experienced a team where pair programming was not a thing and a team where it was, I can definitely say that there are a lot of benefits to pair programming and it can greatly contribute towards a team. In this article, I will go over what pair programming can do for your team and why your team should also adopt it.
No two developers are alike. Every developer has their own way plan of approaching a task, works differently, does things in another way, has different nuggets of information, and so on. This means that‚Ä¶</span>

Your users are definitely not going to be on your app for 24 hours every day. However, you might want to remind them to check your app, or notify them of new things happening in your app even when it&#x27;s closed. You use Push Notifications to achieve this. And contrary to popular belief, they&#x27;re really easy to implement with Flutter and OneSignal.

                    <span>A clean and simple way to keep constants in Flutter is to make an own Dart library in the project for the constants.
For example, we have a project structure like this.

constats.dart
const String BUTTON_LABEL &#x3D; &#x27;Submit&#x27;;

The const keyword is used to represent a compile-time constant. Variables declared with const keyword are implicitly final. Link
You can then use import statement to access to the constants:
import &#x27;package:
/assets/constants.dart&#x27; as constants;
...
ElevatedButton(
  child: const Text(constants.BUTTON_LABEL),
)
...</span>

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
