        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,  this #day-33,  we are going to discuss 5 useful input attributes.
this attribute is almost used with a title attribute that describes the input's pattern, its role is to specify a valid JavaScript regular expression that the input field's value is checked against when the form is submitted. It works with the following input types: (text, email, tel, password, search, url, date).

<form>
    <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="full name..."

        title="the full name should be between 4 and 15 letters"

Output:

maxlength is an input attribute that specifies the maximum length of characters allowed in an input field. And when the length of the input's value is equal to the maxlength, the …]]></summary>

This is why I developed Spottr, a progressive web app that satisfies that curiosity!

Spottr is a PWA developed to surface your Spotify listening habits year-round rather than at the end of each year.
The first main reason as stated above was the burning desire I had to know about how my listening habits have changed over time.
The second reason was to rewrite this project again from scratch using Angular 10, Tailwind CSS, and push my design and front-end development skills. My first iteration was started back in 2018 with Angular 6, but I scrapped that since the project was not pla…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overview


If you're in middle of learning JavaScript or you already completed various online tutorials, you may have came across closures and did not bother much after learning about it. Interestingly you can easily find tons of blogs on this platform explaining closures in depth, but why you should bother reading them? This blog attempts to answer that.
If you're watching one of the tutorials or you've enrolled in a boot camp that briefs JavaScript, they might have touched the concept of closure and there's a high chance you've came across a code like this.
const string = "hello closure";
function print() {
  console.log(string);
}

Which outputs:
hello closure

And a lazy conclusion comes out of this example is that the function insides can get the variable from its parent scope and marking the end of story for closures.
This part of the blog is a bit sloppy, so bear with me a little.
function closure() {
  let counter = 0;
  function onlyExecutesOnce() {
    if(counter == 1) {
      return;
    }
    counter += 1;
    console.log(counter);
  }

  return onlyExecutesOnce;
}


/* testing the function */
const myFunction = closure();
myFunction();
myFunction();
myFunction();

Output:
1

At first glance I didn't not bother much and to my eyes it looked plain and simple.
So, after thinking about my code a question dropped in my mind.
Why is it that myFunction() is sharing the same surrounding environment as onlyExecutesOnce()?
attaching itself with the information from its surrounding of where it was declared. In this case onlyExecutesOnce() is also attached with information of its surrounding which is being passed to myFunction().
So closures, my fellow readers opens a lots of doors for doing crazy and cool stuff in JavaScript.]]></summary>

Docker
In this first step, you need to install Docker on your machine by following the steps below.
1.Update Software Repositories:
sudo apt-get update
2.Install some prerequisite packages that let apt use packages over HTTPS:
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
3.So, add GPG Key to repository Docker on your SO:
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
4.Add the repository Docker to fonts of the APT:
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The spread operator in JavaScript is useful for adding elements to an array, combining arrays and more!


Here's an example:
let arr1 = [1,2,3]; 
let arr2 = [4,5]; 
let arr3 = [...arr1,...arr2]; 
console.log(arr3);
// Output: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] 

As you can see the spread operator(represented as "...") was able to combine "arr1" and "arr2" into "arr3".
The spread operator can also expand arrays:
let arr = ["a","b"]; 
let arr2 = [...arr,"c","d"]; 
console.log(arr2); 
// Output: ["a", "b", "c", "d"]

As you can see, the spread operator here was able to add elements "c" and "d" to "arr", thus creating a bigger array.
The spread operator can also merge objects:
const Person = { 
    name: "Bob", 
    age: 45,
}; 
const ExtraInfo = { 
    country: "Belgium", 
    city: "Brussels", 
}; 
const user = {... Person, ... ExtraInfo};
// Output: {  name: "Bob",  age: 45, country: "Belgium", city: "Brussels" }
