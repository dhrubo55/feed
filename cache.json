When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

In some same cases caused deployments on modules out of the scope of the change. The problem was mainly caused by a large fat interface used throughout all the modules of the system.\nThe solution given by Robert C.
