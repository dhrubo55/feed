          "description": "The splash screen is the first view of your React Native app that a potential user sees. Whether they just downloaded the app or are opening it the thousandth time, users are immediately greeted with your splash screen. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to promote a great user experience around the splash screen.\nThe concept of the splash screen was created as a placeholder to display while the app is loading. This makes phones feel responsive and creates the illusion that the app loads instantly. While this usually works out of the box for native iOS and Android applications, apps using React Native require additional steps during the loading process. This means loading your JavaScript bundle, initializing the JS-Native bridge and loading React.\n\"As your App Bundle grows in size, you may start to see a blank screen flash between your splash screen and the display of your root application view.\"\nUsers‚Äô phones aren‚Äôt aware of the additional loading time, so the splash screen disappears before React and the JavaScript bundle are loaded, and a blank flash occurs. Although the flash is brief, it‚Äôs a terrible user experience and it can feel disorienting.\nThankfully, there‚Äôs an easy fix! You can add the following code to AppDelegate.m in order to keep your splash screen displayed during the transition:\n\nNow rebuild your app and enjoy the seamless splash screen!",

First of all this platform is really great and interactive and that's what I needed most in these early days of being an apprentice in learning about web development. \nI started learning about Web Dev in January of 2021 and for the past 6 months I have covered the basics of HTML5 and CSS. \nWhat I learned so far is:\nDon't fall in the trap called \"Learn Web Dev in 30 Mins\"\n\n\nGive yourself a time to learn\n\n\nInteraction with other developers is a must\n\n\nDo projects\n\n\nAvoid Burnouts\n\n\n\nThese are things I have learned from my 6 months of learning and doing some projects in 2021. Hope it will help someone in being a better developer. \nAll the best in your journey to learn and be an agent of transformations in tech universe. \nUntil Next time, be safe.",

This post is available as a video podcast at evan.streambus.com.\n\nYou're used to using things that are feature complete, so you look at your early product and feel that it's \"dull\" or \"sparse\".\nThis isn't an aesthetics problem, it's a your-product-is-early problem. Be comfortable with this stage; don't try and add extra fonts, colors, borders, and other decorations.\n\nInstead, build features, and your product will evolve naturally. \n\nYou likely already have a color palette, but keeping a spacing palette can help you avoid unintentional contrast, especially when you have multiple people working on one project.\nFor example:\n.p-big {\n  padding: 24px;\n}\n\n.p-medium {\n  padding: 12px;\n}\n\n.p-small {\n  padding: 4px;\n}\n\n\nMake sure it's clear what you want a user to do. If you add a big background to one button, but make another one big and blue, it's not clear which one is \"more\" important.\nTo avoid this, plan out what an \"primary\" button looks like, what a \"secondary\" button looks like, and so on.\n\nMost icon sets are meant to have roughly the same size as the text. They're meant to be similar to a character.\nIf you need something big, consider using a stock photo or illustration. Or, consider removing the icon and just letting the text speak for itself.\n\nMany professionally designed websites don't use pure gray-scales (like #000000 black). Instead, their grays are darker, desaturated versions of their other brand colors.\nConsider using palx.jxnblk.com to generate a grayscale color palette for your brand color.\n\nSome vector art is better than others, and can distract from your design. Consider using blush.design to get some professional assets instead.\nConsider using unsplash images instead of art assets. Or, if it works for your project, consider letting your design exist without art assets entirely! Not everything needs illustrations.",
