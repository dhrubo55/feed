This tutorial will cover the .splice() and .indexOf() array methods and their application in removing a specific item from an array in JavaScript.
It's the year 3025. Humanity has finally got out of the solar system and is now exploring new frontiers. Unfortunately, JavaScript still has not got a .remove() method.
Let's start with a simple array. The contents or data types inside of it don't matter.
const numbers = [1, 5, 2, 5, 3, 5]

Now, suppose we need to remove the number 2. Let's see how to do that:
const removeItem = (arr, val) => {
    const index = arr.indexOf(val)
    if (index > -1) {
        arr.splice(index, 1)
    }
    return arr
}

removeItem(numbers, 2)

console.log(numbers)
// [1, 5, 5, 3, 5]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitLab commit is just a few days away, and I'm excited to talk about how to "Upgrade your development workflow with runtime code maps". Attendance is free; visit https://gitlabcommitvirtual2021.com/ for details. My talk is on Tuesday August 3 at 9:40 AM PDT. I'll be around online after the talk to chat and answer questions.
In anticipation of the talk, we've added support for GitLab to AppMap, our open source project which records your code, in your local dev environment, to create and share visual code maps. 
In this brief video, you can see how to:
Record AppMaps in your code editor (VSCode or JetBrains) or with a Chrome browser extension.
View AppMap visual dependency map and execution trace in the code editor.
Upload AppMaps to the AppMap Cloud - a place to store and  share them - logging in with GitLab.
Attach links to AppMaps stored in AppMap Cloud to your GitLab merge requests.
You can use this workflow to find out exactly what code, web services, dependency services, and SQL is used in any use case or test case, and how all that code and data fits together. 
Then you can share AppMaps with your dev team so that they can see exactly what you see. For example, exactly how you spotted and fixed a bug.
Check it out, and I hope to see you at GitLab Commit 2021!]]></summary>

I use a simple loading object of true/false flags that I toggle whenever that loading state changes. Messaging, loading indicators, and entire content sections are driven by these flags. 
Even though there are cases where I could use the presence or absence of the relevant data, using a separate object provides the flexibility needed for any design requirement. 
An example:

For instance, if you are building an application with core PHP, and have about ten tables in your database, each with its unique set of columns. Imagine having to write insert method for each of these tables, and then update methods for each. That will work but it is tedious and more prone to bugs. 
How about you have a single insert method that when supplied with table name and inputs, viola it inserts the table in the table. Just any table at all-that is to say that this insert method is table agnostic. Behind the scene, this method is a dynamic MySQL query builder. Now, this is abstract and reusable code.

üéâPicking a PythonVersion: A Manifesto 
This report guides you through the implicit decision tree of choosing what Python version, implementation, and distribution is best suited for you. It weighs and discusses the merits of each of these choices, and briefly discusses the reasons each option exists.

To tap into the power of Python‚Äôs open data science stack ‚Äî including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and other tools ‚Äî you first need to understand the syntax, semantics, and patterns of the Python language.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Buttons are one of the most common elements in all of UI. It'll probably be the first thing you see when you open up a new component library or start working on a new project.
They can be surprisingly complex when you factor in all the different states and implications a button can have when pressed, clicked, or tapped.
Think about these differnt states you need to consider when designing a button:
Full color, outlined, or "ghost" buttons
Loading, disabled, and submitting states
Button sizes like sm, md, and lg
Hover, focus, and active states
Buttons used as links, vs buttons used as... well, buttons
After all is said and done, you can still do more to make sure your button looks "clickable". Here are a couple ways you can enhance a button.
Overlap content sections


Add animations


Add cursor: pointer




  
  
  1. Overlap content sections


An element that sits on top of 2 sections looks like it almost "floats", and looks like it could be clicked.

Entrance animations, hover animations, and tap animations can all add to a button in subtle but important ways.
Consider scaling the button or text within it when you hover or click.
It makes a button obviously clickable to have a little finger pop up over a button! Consider adding it to something you know will be clicked.
You can't rely on this to signal a button is clickable though for users who navigate without a cursor.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Fauna‚Äôs document streaming feature in a Python application.
Here for the code alone? Head over to the implementation section¬†of this article.
Streaming refers to when a program continuously reads and fetches data from a given source in real-time. For example, while watching a YouTube video or downloading a file from the internet, you stream the data from the origin and process it on your client‚Äôs device instantaneously.

Streaming, in some ways, can arguably be a better alternative to polling. Polling refers to when a client periodically makes queries to a data source to get updates. It is more expensive than streaming as the client sends ‚Ä¶]]></summary>
