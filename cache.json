The time has come to chose a topic and start building something from scratch.\nExcited and terrified\nUp until this point all the exercises I had worked on came with the basic design already built in and it was just a matter on knowing how to pass props from one component to another, or how to update the State. Once I was asked to build everything from scratch I felt completely lost.\nWith no time to loose I decided to build and app related to something I'm passionate about, something I enjoy doing on my own. Is then when it hit me. Camera Equipment!! Huge surprise...\nI have a lot of camera equipment that I some times buy and sell in order to buy other camera related things. Why not building something that could help me keep track of my purchases?\nOnce I decided the topic it was time to start building it, but first, I wanted to plan out the entire app on a piece of paper. No surprises this time. No more build-as-you-go.\n\nFrom ideation to execution\nOk. I had the idea and I knew what the app would do. I also had a roadmap of how it should look like (kinda...), now I only had to figure out how to make it work.\n\nThe incredible power of React\nAt this point I have been working on Your Camera Gear for two weeks and I am still polishing code and fixing some bugs here and there, but the bulk of the application was made really really quickly. I'd say I was able to put together a semi good looking website within the first two days of working on it. It was already fetching info from my database and displaying it nicely on my homepage, and it had several components built in into the home page and there were a couple of events triggering when clicking in my items.\nNot only that, some of the components I had built were very easy to recycle and create new components off of the existing code. It is just a matter of which props they are receiving. Simply amazing.",

Let's see an example:\nApp:\nimport { add } from './math.js'; \n\n// math.js\n\nexport function add(a, b) {\n\n  return a + b;\n}\n\n\nconsole.log(add(2, 4)); // 6\n\nBundle:\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\n\nconsole.log(add(2,4)); // 6\n\nAs our app grows, our bundle will grow, especially when using large third-party libraries.

          "description": "What is Node.js\n\n\nNode.js is an open-source Javascript run-time. It is used to create server-side APIs, network applications and services. It was designed to build out highly scalable applications with high concurrency.\nNode has made it very easy for frontend developers to create full-stack projects by using prior Javascript experience on the server side. This has been great for teams to re-use codebases and increase productivity.  \nNode is built on the V8 chrome javascript engine that has yielded amazing performance. The asynchronous non-blocking design makes for a blazing fast experience dealing with lots of concurrent operations. \nNode.js makes it really easy to produce real-time applications such a real-time chats by allowing synchronized  connections via websockets and reliable client/server communication.\nThe event driven architecture of Node.js is pattern on observing event behavior with event listeners and responding to events predictively. These is perfect for client-side web applications make use of many meaningful interactions on the interface and providing a great user experience. \nNode is supported by the entire Javascript community and has lots of great open-source tooling and NPM packages that make developing with Node a breeze. Node is quickly being adopting in tech stacks of lots of companies and producing great results in performance. \nTerry Threatt",

          "description": "When building backend of a web application, we often need to call APIs of remote servers. It is not a big deal when we have to make just one or two API calls per requests. But most of the time we have to make two or more API calls depending on the requests. That's when problem occurs. Because the more API calls you make, the longer it will need to serve the data.\nLet's assume you have to handle a request which requires five API calls. You make five API calls one by one. When all of the data is available, you clean, format and merge them and send it to the frontend. Let's say it takes six seconds to get data from all of the API calls. Six seconds may seem feasible but it's always better to make things efficient and faster whenever possible. \nSo, to serve the request faster we can make all t‚Ä¶",
