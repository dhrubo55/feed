https://github.com/wscats/jest-architecture
Jest is a Javascript testing framework developed by Facebook. It is a JavaScript library for creating, running and writing tests.
Jest is released as an NPM package and can be installed and run in any JavaScript project. Jest is currently one of the most popular test libraries for the front-end.
In technical terms, testing means checking whether our code meets certain expectations. For example: a function called sum (sum) should return the expected output given some operation result.
There are many types of tests, and you will soon be overwhelmed by the terminology, but the long story short tests fall into three categories:
unit test
Integration Testing
E2E test
In terms of testing, even the simplest code block may confuse beg…]]></summary>

Becoming familiar with git config and the various Git configuration settings will help you create a powerful, customized Git workflow.
Git Config and Git Aliases
The git config command is a convenience function that is used to set Git configuration values on a global or local project level. These configuration levels correspond to .gitconfig text files.
Mainly there are three config levels 
--local
--global
--system
NOTE: the order of priority for configuration levels is: local, global, system. This means when looking for a configuration value, Git will start at the local level and bubble up to the system level.

getElementById is used to return an element using his id. If there is no element with the giving id, it returns null.
<h1 id="logo">Aya Bouchiha</h1>
<script>
    const logo = document.getElememntById('logo');
    const img  = document.getElementById('img'); // null
</script>

querySelector is used to return the first element that matches the giving CSS selector.
<input type="search" placeholder="search" />
<script>
const searchInput = document.querySelector("[type='search']");
</script>

querySelectorAll is used to return all elements (as a NodeList object) that matche the giving css selector.
<div>Hi</div>
<div>Bonjour</div>
<div>Salam</div>
<button onclick="changeColor()">To Blue</button>
<script>
const changeColor = () => {
  document.querySelectorAll("div").forEach(div => div.style.color="blue")
}
</script>


getElementById: for selecting an element using his Id
querySelector: for getting the first element that matches the giving css selector
querySelectorAll: for returning as a NodeList object All elements that matche the giving css selector.

Después de aplicar estas técnicas, tus imágenes en CSS se llevarán mejor con los lectores de pantalla, personas con necesidades específicos de colores, gente con trastornos vestibulares o vértigo... y todo sin impactar negativamente tu arte o tu creatividad. Todos ganan.

I felt there was a story in the data that needed to be told. Despite having the largest Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of all EU countries, and some of the richest fishing grounds, UK fleets are restricted to quite modest catches.
Initially, I had grand plans to create a sort of ‘flow map’ that would trace the translocation of fish from fishing grounds to the country of landing. The Common Fisheries Policy provides EU states with mutual access to each other's fishing grounds, but sets quotas that are largely based on catch figures from 40 years ago which today seem arbitrary. Earlier this year, the UK government was pushing to reverse this by …]]></summary>

So let's say, you wanna introduce RTL in your web platform, and you have no idea where to start. And so, you start to look around the internet or even ask your colleagues, and you come up to read or hear something like this:

Dev : Sure. Hoisting is a phenomenon in which JavaScript magically🤺 moves the code to the top.

Dev : Sure. Gives an example where we can call a function on a line which is before the function initialization.
Interviewer : Hmm.
In the end you wont get the Job.
I too have seen many tutorials, blogs and sites where they mentioned the same. But programming is not magic. There lies a logic. So, lets actually see how actually HOISTING works.
We know that when we run a script, a Global Execution Context (GEC) is created which consists of two phases. Memory creation phase and Execution phases i.e. run phase.
