Here&#x27;s how to achieve this using pure JS!

                    <span>This is a term that has been growing for past years. But, what is exactly a micro frontend?
Since the dawn of the internet era, we have been writing code to make the web interactive. For the past decade, the term web application has became a thing. All this time the frontend code was just a big, solid and entangled monolith.
When we write web apps, we usually choose a framework to help us (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, and others) and architect it over layers such as models, views and controllers. All the code happily lives in one great repository.
As the monolith grows, it becomes more and more difficult to understand all of the code and draw a clear line of the business requirements
Big compiled javascript monoliths can take a long time to build

                    <span>In the last article, we asked ourselves how the operating system gives each process the illusion that it has its own address space despite only having one hardware RAM. This is one of the most important and most complicated virtualization techniques that the operating system performs. Because of that we will discuss memory virtualization in three separate articles. The goals of the operating system with respect to memory are as follows:
Give processes a contiguous address space
Give processes memory isolation from each other
Do both of the above efficiently with respect to memory usage and processing speed
Let’s first talk about what memory is. Memory can be thought of as a series of slots. 32-bit memory has 32-bit slots and 64-bit memory has 64-bit slots. The size of a computer’s memory c…</span>

                    <span>In the previous article, we spoke about grammar and what we need to complete this project.
It’s now time to finally dig into the coding part.
To set up the environment we first need to create a folder for the project and the virtualenv we’ll use for it.
mkdir pyregex  
cd pyregexpython3 -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate

For this project, we will use a couple of python libraries:
pip3 install numpy  
pip3 install autopep8

Autopep8 isn’t needed for the project itself, but I use it to help me with keeping formatting uniform throughout the codebase.
On the other hand, we’ll use NumPy to build the AST.
Inside pyregex, we create an src folder where we will place all our code.
The __init__.py files you see are empty files needed by python to navigate through the project.

                    <span>MongoDB is a NoSQL database that more than a quarter of developers use in some capacity. What makes MongoDB and other NoSQL DBs attractive is flexibility; instead of being held to a rigid schema that scales vertically, you can evolve your schema as you grow and scale horizontally. MongoDB went public in 2017 and is worth more than $17 billion today.
Document DBs work through nested key-value pairs instead of relational tables and columns. You’re going to need to parse data for your front-end eventually, and with document DBs, your data is already stored in the right format (give or take a .map or .reduce). Working with MongoDB through the command line isn’t exactly a cakewalk: This post will walk through the best MongoDB GUIs available for reading from and writing to your MongoDB clusters.…</span>

another thing before starting: sorry for my english, this is not my natural language and I&#x27;ll write smoothly so I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find some errors. 
Let&#x27;s start now
first of all, a brief introduction to TDD and why everyone should use it.

Politics is a taboo in tech circles. I’m out of my base here, but in some camps politics led to a meltdown after some gems of privileged men in power. But we are social animals. Politics is everywhere because is about everything we do. As simple as a Wikipedia definition can be, politics “is the set of activities that are associated with deciding in groups, or other forms of power relations between individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status&quot;.

                    <span>You&#x27;ve probably encountered asynchronous tasks many times inside React components. A typical approach is to split a complex asynchronous task into multiple synchronous ones, wrap them with useEffect, and synchronize those effects through dependencies. In very simple cases, this is not that difficult and expensive, although our component is re-rendered every time we change state, even if some state variables are not used in JSX rendering. But when the task gets more complex, we have to worry about these unnecessary re-renders, using the useMemo hook and other techniques. We can&#x27;t just use asynchronous functions inside components as we cannot get state updates during its execution due to the nature of JavaScript closures. Moreover, we have to cancel the running asynchronous tasks when compon…</span>

                    <span>As a &quot;toy&quot; I decided to try and revive an old version of Microsoft&#x27;s Azure Pipelines Agent on an image from before they made that Azure Services Only.   However, I updated the agent on the ubuntu-16.04-tfs-2018-u2 image to a later version of the linux agent.  (2.140.2)
https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-azure-pipelines-vsts-agent
I had to also update the Team Explorer Everywhere (TEE/TEE-cli) that was embedded in that to the latest version. And upgrade java to version 11.   But once that was done, it works well.  Its a tad on the large size for an image.  (1gb), but it seems ok on its memory and CPU usage.  See the kubebox graph at the bottom.


Does anyone think this could be more than just a toy ?  I&#x27;m a novice at most Kubernetes stuff compared to the folks here, but I wanted to share this.</span>

                    <span>Profitability ratios are financial metrics offering insights on how good a company is able to generate earnings from revenues, assets and equity. In this post, we will perform a profitability margin analysis with Python by comparing profitability ratios across peer companies. Below are the 5 different related profitability ratios that we will calculate and analyse:
  Net Profit Margin
  Gross Profit
  Operating Profit
  Return on Assets
  Return on Equity

NetlifyCMS is a great headless content management system that has good defaults, is flexible enough to fulfill most needs, has a pluggable API, and works well if you host your content on GitHub. I have also contributed to the project when it was at the very early stage. For obvious reasons, Netlify CMS works really well when you host on Netlify but unfortunately things become a bit more complicated if you decide to move to another hosting provider.
This is due to a requirement of GitHub’s authentication flow. To use a GitHub backend with NetlifyCMS, you have to run you…</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
