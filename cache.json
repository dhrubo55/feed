When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

The first one is the data, the second is a replacer function, and the third one is the indentation.\nThe main topic of this article is the third argument. If you provide a string as the third argument, that string will be used as indentation. Here's an example:\nJSON.stringify({a: 'B', c: {d: 'e'}})\n// => {\"a\":\"B\",\"c\":{\"d\":\"e\"}}\nJSON.stringify({a: 'B', c: {d: 'e'}}, null, \"  \")\n// => \n// {\n//   \"a\": \"B\",\n//   \"c\": {\n//     \"d\": \"e\"\n//   }\n// }\nJSON.stringify({a: 'B', c: {d: 'e'}}, null, \"test\")\n// =>\n// {\n// test\"a\": \"B\",\n// test\"c\": {\n// testtest\"d\": \"e\"\n// test}\n// }\n\nYou can also pass in a number instead. If you do so, that many spaces will be inserted as indentation:\nJSON.stringify({a: 'B', c: {d: 'e'}}, null, 2)\n// => \n// {\n//   \"a\": \"B\",\n//   \"c\": {\n//     \"d\": \"e\"\n//   }\n// }\n\nHope this helps you while debugging sometime!",

The chances of the same UUID getting generated twice are negligible.\nThe problem with UUIDs is that they are very big in size and don’t index well.
