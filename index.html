My friend told me to write some parts of this game in French, so I had to use A LOT of Google translate. Anyways, hope you like this game! If you have something to tell me about this pen, please do so in the comment section, any feedback is appreciated and I can improve this game.
READ: If you would like to make your own map, you just have to add a new array level in the &quot;niveau&quot; variable at the end of the script :)

                    <span>The release of Hotwire in late 2020 brought attention to a growing interest within the Rails community in building modern, reactive Rails applications without needing the complexity of an API + SPA.
Although Hotwire&#x27;s Turbo library garnered a lot of attention, the Rails community has been working for years to improve the toolset we have to build modern, full-stack Rails applications. Turbo isn&#x27;t the first attempt at giving Rails developers the tools they need.
One of the most important of these projects is CableReady, which powers StimulusReflex and Optimism, along with standing on its own as a tool to:

For the rest of your life as a developer you will bump into problems that you simply DONT KNOW how to start, how to solve, and you will to discover by yourself. Its part of the game. How you handle this situation will define part of the type of professional you are and will be. the way that you will organize the problems, thing, present and attack them matters. So let&#x27;s go to some important points about it:
Did you get the task but didn&#x27;t understood the description? So it&#x27;s useless to ask the Dev next to you &quot;hey, I don&#x27;t know how to do handle this, can you help me?&quot;. Even if he/she explains, you won&#x27;t understand because you didn&#x27;t even understood what to do, or what kind of problem is happening.
It&#x27;s okay not to understand the bri…</span>

                    <span>Oh My Zsh is quite poplar ecosystem allows people to run useful scenarios to customize their terminals as well to deal with typical tasks.
A couple years ago I created the Tomtit and since then this has been bothering me - how similar it is to what ohmyzsh does ...
Well, not exactly, but it&#x27;s written on Raku.
Tomit allows to write portable scripts and execute them to satisfy users&#x27; needs. The same what ohmyzsh plugins do


Unlike ohmyzsh  plugins which are written on Zshell, Tomtit plugins could be written on similar Bash or many other languages supported by Sparrow ( on which the Tomtit is built on )


Unlike ohmyzsh  scenarios, Tomtit scenarios get run as Raku scripts and thus are highly customizable. In ohmyzsh you only have shell aliases or functions


Ohmyzh has 275+ plugins which is …</span>

After learning about the exciting, but sadly only Stage 1 proposal for pattern-matching in JavaScript, I felt compelled to write a library that tries to, erm, match it as closely as I could:
import { match, when, otherwise } from &#x27;match-iz&#x27;

match(haystack)(
  when(needle)(true),
  when(thread)(false),
  otherwise(&#x27;bale&#x27;)
)

Essentially, pattern-matching is if/then and switch/case with a little more declarative cowbell. 🐮 🔔
We can probe into an object:
const todosReducer &#x3D; (state, action) &#x3D;&gt;
  match(action)(
    when({ type: &#x27;set-vis-filter&#x27; })
      (({ visFilter }) &#x3D;&gt; ({
        ...state,
        visFilter
      })),

    when({ type: &#x27;add-todo&#x27; })
      (({ text }) &#x3D;&gt; ({
        ...state,
        todos: [...state.todos, { text, completed: false }]

                    <span>A function is a mini-program that performs a task. In general, a program consists of multiple small functions. These functions are just small pieces of a big program that have input, processing, and output.
Sometimes we want a particular program or task to execute repeatedly with different inputs each time. Here comes the role of a function that executes the processing logic with different input and output.
Now you have a basic understanding about function, let&#x27;s discuss how to create a function.
&quot;Declare a function&quot; is just a rephrase of &quot;Create a function&quot;
You need three things to create a simple function:
function keyword
name of the function
statement or logic
Let&#x27;s create a function -
function add(){
    //statement
    console.log(2+3);
};

                    <span>So now we have some basics in webpack knowledge!
If you check the HTML file and the webpack config you should see something wrong, no?
Whenever we need to change the name of the output, for example from bundle.js to output.js, we need to change it in our HTML file. Same issue if we want to add another output file like CSS file before!
A plugin will be used to save us HtmlWebpackPlugin! 
It will inject our output file directly in our HTML ! It will be very helpful when we will use a hash name (waiting for the next webpack academy to check this 😇) ! 
So we can remove the import in our HTML file

In this article I will talk about what TotalCross is, how it works and about TotalCross in VS Code.
TotalCross is a Java based cross-platform SDK technology, aiming to make life easier for the developer or even the common user.It has a very low footprint, taking up a small amount of space on your device, less than 5MB in fact. Being cross-platform, the developer only needs to worry about learning the basics of Java and the TotalCross library to be able to run the program on embedded systems, Windows, Linux, Mac, IOS and Android.

Secure localStorage data with high level of encryption and data compression.

Compress data before storing it to localStorage to save extra bytes (defaults to true).
Advanced API wrapper over localStorage API, providing other basic utilities.
Save data in multiple keys inside localStorage and secure-ls will always remember it&#x27;s creation.
