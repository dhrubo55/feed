VSCode is without a doubt a fantastic experience when you get your workflow set up. VSCode also is a memory hog in comparison to Sublime Text 4. 
Not an extensive test. 
My VSCode has extensions running vs. a clean install of Sublime Text 4. The same project and tabs are open in each editor.
The difference in memory is vast.

JavaScript falsy means false of boolean condition context. Mainly, six expressions are called falsy. They are false, ‚Äò‚Äô(empty string), undefined, null, NaN and 0. And the rest of the expression treats truthy. For example ‚Äì
let value &#x3D; NaN;

if(value) {
    console.log( ‚ÄúTruthy value‚Äù);
} else {
    console.log( ‚ÄúFalsy value‚Äù );
