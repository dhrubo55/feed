&quot;VanillaJS&quot; is a term that developers use to describe regular JavaScript. It means using the inbuilt JavaScript methods and objects without any additional libraries or frameworks.
So why use VanillaJS instead of libraries or frameworks? Well, we gotta admit libraries like ReactJS are just amazing but VanillaJS is faster than any other JavaScript framework because it has fewer overheads. Moreover, Using frameworks or libraries in JS is a little like using Bootstrap or Tailwind in CSS, we might miss out on the fundamentals, it eliminates control over your abilities to solve the prob…</span>

                    <span>Abel Wang (1972-2021) was Principal Program Manager, Technical Assistant to the CTO of Azure at Microsoft. 
For many years he was a DevOps enthusiast, and in fact he worked as DevOps Lead and Advocate in the Donovan Brown&#x27;s team until the recent promotion.
You may know him by his nickname AbelSquidHead. He used to be a speaker at many technical events and conferences, and also either a host or guest of countless videos.
Abel was hands down one of the most passionate DevOps practitioners I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure to listen to. Actually, he was one of the most passionate people in everything he did.
He passed away in July 2021, cancer took him away.
This is my small tribute to him, to one of the best of us all.
In memory of Abel Wang. Rest in Peace. You are and will always be sorely missed.

Una de las cosas difíciles en el desarrollo web y programación en general es el nombramiento de las cosas y el nombramiento en CSS no es diferente.
Cuando trabajas en un proyecto pequeño el nombramiento no es una prioridad pero si es una buena practica, todo cambia cuando se convierte en un proyecto grande, entonces el nombramiento se vuelve primordial, mantener el rastro de todos los selectores se vuelve un caos sin una convención de nombres, usar alguna hará la tarea fácil.
El código se volverá sencillo de leer, mantener y modificar.
Una convención de nombres es un conjunto de reglas para la elección de la secuencia de caracteres que se utilice para identificadores que denoten variables, tipos, funciones y otras entidades en el código fuente y la documentación.

                    <span>React is a popular JavaScript library for many reasons and one of the reasons is “one-way data binding”. If you want to understand React to its core, you should read along.
It’s a one-way road for the data
React apps are made up of carefully organized components. These components receive arguments(props) and return information using the return value of the render function. When data flows from the parent to the child component, it is known as the unidirectional flow of data.
Parent component passes information to child component using props. But it is also possible that a child component might end up requiring to change something in the UI. What to do in that case?
Is it possible to pass data from the child to parent component?
What if clicking a button in the child component changes the t…</span>

                    <span>Connecting node.js project with MySQL database is easy, follow the following steps to connect to the the database
By reading this article I believe you have installed nodee Js on your system and familiar with it.
 Step1
Open your code editor.
 Step2
Create a new project
 mkdir project_name
 cd project_name

 Step3
Create project file.
 npm init -y

into the command prompt or terminal.
 Step4
To be able to connect to mysql database you need to install MySQL module into your project.
To do this is very simple, open your CMD or terminal and enter
 npm install mysql

this command will install the module into your project.
 Step5
Now we can open connection From our project code to mysql database

const mysql &#x3D; require(&#x27;mysql&#x27;);

// Creating a mysql connection
const conn &#x3D; mysql.createConnection({
   host: &quot;localhost&quot;,
   user: &quot;db_username&quot;,
   password: &quot;db_password&quot;,
   database: &quot;db_name&quot;
});

 Step6
Let create a simple database and table
conn.connect((err)&#x3D;&gt;{
   if (err) throw err;
      console.log(&quot;Database connected successful&quot;);
   var sql &#x3D; &quot;CREATE TABLE books (book_name VARCHAR(255), book_description VARCHAR(255))&quot;;
   con.query(sql,(err, result)&#x3D;&gt; {
      if (err) throw err;
         console.log(&quot;Table created&quot;);
   });
});

In five minutes I walk through debugging a web project bit by bit:
I open a project inside VS Code by opening its folder. The demo used is a simple, plain Vanilla JS/CSS/HTML ToDo app you can download/fork on GitHub.
I open a Terminal inside VS Code and start a local server. I use the server that comes with PHP as it already on my computer (for now - MacOS will soon deprecate this option)
Instead of opening the project in the browser, I use the run and debug workflow of VS Code to open a dedicated browser instance to debug this project with. If I have a Chromium based browser on my device and have it set as my default browser, this will be the one VS Code uses. In …</span>

Jeff joined Dev Interrupted to give us insight into his book and the secrets behind Facebook’s success, the founding story of the Software Daily podcast, the inside scoop on his new company SuperCompute, and how the skills and logic behind poker translate to software engineering.

                    <span>As a dev, I find myself constantly thinking about the variety of languages that are out there and if there&#x27;s one that I would &quot;prefer&quot; over the others. While I can see why that mindset could be a harmful one to a developers.....development, it&#x27;s still a thought that occasionally crosses my mind. In cases like these it never hurts to feed the curiosity though. 
I recently started a Udemy Python Course. I decided to finally take the chance to see what it was all about. So far I&#x27;ve been able to successfully create a bandname generator. To achieve this, I had to become familiar with the print function, the input function and variable assignment within the language.

As your organization grows, it&#x27;s common for multiple API services to be created, each one providing its own feature set. Alongside these services, you’ll want to provide different client apps for your users to use your product. Eventually, your architecture might look like this:








Every client app has different needs



There are many reasons why this happens. Over time, team structure may have directed service creation, and at the time, it was easier to have a single team own a single codebase instead of having a web of teams to service ownership.
Another reason could be that different features in your product had different scaling concerns. For example, your analytics stack may have drastically different needs than your user login stack, and it doesn&#x27;t m…</span>

                    <span>Have you ever wanted to add maps to your Svelte app?
So, we&#x27;re already seeing some great feedback on our Amplify Geo developer preview release - thanks to everyone who has taken the time to play with it. I thought I&#x27;d share some hacky code I threw together to try out using our new CDN-delivered Amplify libraries in an mostly-unbundled Svelte app. 
CDN-powered unbundling can be nice. Until recently, Amplify-powered JS apps have been conventionally bundled at build time. CDN unbundling is particularly handy for Svelte+Rollup, because none of the Amplify libraries need to be parsed each build iteration, meaning lightning-fast refreshes. Also, the resulting bundle is pretty small. My bundle.js for this app  is just 19Kb, unminified.
