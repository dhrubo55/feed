                    <span>In this tutorial we’ll be building a simple accordion component for use in React applications. This type of component is useful for things like FAQ’s when you want to break up a large amount of content into smaller more consumable pieces.
Here’s what the completed component will look like:

Let’s get started by using Create React App to setup the development environment:
npx create-react-app react-accordion

Next create a new Accordion.js file in the /src directory with the following code:
import React, { useState } from &quot;react&quot;;
import &quot;./accordion.css&quot;;

const Accordion &#x3D; ({ heading, content }) &#x3D;&gt; {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] &#x3D; useState(false);
  return (
    
 setIsActive(!isActive)}&gt;

Fortunately, this can be accomplished instantly with the  component ( for React Native) from the &#x27;easybase-react&#x27; package.
The final result will look like this:
export default function App() {
  return (
    
      
        
You&#x27;re In!
You&#x27;re In!
 component is highly customizable when it comes to CSS and forms, read here for customization.
To sign out, import useEasybase and call the signOut function:
function User() {
  const { signOut } &#x3D; useEasybase()
  return Sign Out
}

export default function App() {
  return (

}

All users will appear in the Easybase interface, under the Users tab:

.getContext was something that I had never done before and I definitely want to do more in depth research on the different aspects of it. This exercise also used event listeners and functions to listen for the events needed to draw onto the created canvas&#x27; x and y axis. This exercise also utilized mothereffinghsl to get the color gradiant hue for our drawn line working in conjunction with the event listeners.

Loved this overview. I learned a few things about DevTools that I did not know before as well as all the varieties of console. that can be used. I had mostly used console.log() and console.dir() before and was surprised at just how many there are and the variety of ways they can be used! I feel like I&#x27;ve been missing out not knowing about console.table()!!

This exercise worked with checkboxes and using the shift key to be able to select multiple checkboxes at a time. This was done by programmatically setting the boxes to checked with JavaScript until you click the last one. Until the last one clicked is selected, our flag variable gets set to false which makes this functionality work both when selecting from the bottom to the top top or vice versa, by setting the variable equal to this or to lastChecked. The variable is declared with the let keyword because it is a variable that can change.</span>

In this article, you will learn how to build a simple web application with Vue.js, query your data from Sanity, and make it a Progressive Web Application (PWA) by installing the PWA plugin. In making it a PWA, the app will be able to be installed on mobile phones.
You can see the deployed app here and see the final code here.

To understand this guide you should have:
Basic understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript
At least little experience or knowledge of Vue.js


Node and npm or yarn installed on your computer
Basic knowledge of how the terminal
PWA stands for Progressive Web App. Google Chrome engineer Alex Russell introduced the term in his blog post in 2015. Since then, Google has been promoting the use of PWAs actively and has provided a lot of resources on the topic …</span>

I&#x27;m writing some articles about developer workflow tools for people using Kubernetes. Some of the apps I&#x27;m writing about are for fast feedback while writing code that runs in clusters, like Tilt, Skaffold and DevSpace.
The other pretty obvious class of tools is the tools for provisioning local clusters like MiniKube, Docker Desktop, k3s, and kind.

                    <span>Resolvendo &quot;error: module was created for incompatible target arm64-apple-ios9.0&quot;
Meu primeiro dia de trabalho foi bem interessante, ainda não tínhamos testado o projeto em um computador Mac com Apple Silicon (M1), com isso, tivemos um erro subindo o projeto. 
Uma informação que nos ajudará a entender o problema é que, com essa nova plataforma teremos o macOS baseado em arm64, seus simuladores também serão executados em arm64, ao contrário da atual arquitetura x86/64 baseada na Intel.
O projeto do trabalho, que havia sido criado com arquitetura x64, tem algumas dependências que não suportam a nova arquitetura dos MacBooks, então foi preciso mexer em uma configuração.
Como podemos ver abaixo, foi assim que ficou o Build Settings após fazer as alterações, fomos em Excluded Architectures, depois em Debug e Release adicionamos a arquitetura que queremos excluir quando subirmos o projeto no simulador (Any iOS Simulator).

Nesse vídeo eu mostro como configurei, porém em outro projeto que estava mexendo. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;l3Cmcyqbvxg
Lembrando que eu não rodo o projeto em um celular, e sim no simulador do Xcode mesmo.
Fazendo isso, pode acontecer com que o build fique mais lento, porque ele praticamente faz a transcrição do código com a arquitetura x64 (Intel) para a arm64 (Apple Silicon), mas isso resolveu o problema, já que iremos evitar as dependências que não suportam essa nova arquitetura de nos impedir de subir o projeto. 
O M1 consegue executar códigos feitos na arquitetura Intel com o Rosetta 2. Um link interessante sobre isso aqui 
E um agradecimento final ao meu líder que conseguiu me explicar isso pacientemente e me ajudar a solucionar o problema. Obrigada, Felipe!</span>

                    <span>So, you have a frontend app, written in a SPA framework like Angular, React, Vue or maybe Svelte? And you want to find the quickest way to get it to the Cloud? There are many ways to do so, GitHub, Azure Storage, but there&#x27;s also Azure Static Web Apps service. 
So, there are a few moving parts that you may or may not use, like the below
Frontend, this is your app written in a framework like Angular, React.js, Vue.js etc


API, this is your backend that you build using Azure functions, so it&#x27;s Serverless which is great on your wallet but also for architecting with events in the Cloud


Auth, auth is always a bit cumbersome but great once it&#x27;s up and running.

  Description:



(Jump to: Solution Idea || Code: JavaScript | Python | Java | C++)
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k.
You are initially standing at index 0. In one move, you can jump at most k steps forward without going outside the boundaries of the array. That is, you can jump from index i to any index in the range [i + 1, min(n - 1, i + k)] inclusive.
You want to reach the last index of the array (index n - 1). Your score is the sum of all nums[j] for each index j you visited in the array.
Return the maximum score…</span>

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.</span>

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
