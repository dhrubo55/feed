HTTP response status codes are three-digit responses from the server to the browser-side request. such as 500 and 404.
www.umbraco.com
These are the most famous HTTP Status Codes, for more details:

https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/
100: (Continue) means that the initial part of the request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server.


102: (Processing) this status code means that the server has received and is processing the request. But no response is available yet

                    <span>GitHub Actions is a very cool tool for automating CI/CD pipeline workflows or any routine task. Once the code resides in Github, automating tasks from using Github actions is achievable.

Github Actions allows Engineers to create a very simple workflow to automate code compilation and deployment. Github Actions is very easy to use and it makes deployment to production very easy and interesting.
Actions are defined in YAML files, which allows pipeline workflow to be triggered using any GitHub events like on creation of Pull Requests, on code commits, and much more

Take the survey here!
Last year when we ran the survey, we had over 3000 responses, and we&#x27;d love to blow that number out of the water. We&#x27;re excited to see the year-over-year trends for the category. Seeing which frameworks are growing, which ones are losing ground, which ones make you happiest, which CMS people love the most... it&#x27;ll be so interesting to see how that has changed over the past year! You can see last year&#x27;s results here.
Plus, you can get a limited-edition Jamstack sticker with your responses 👀 get &#x27;em in quick!
Once again, here&#x27;s the link to take the survey. It should take you about 5 minutes, and we&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts!</span>

                    <span>¿Qué es git y github?

Git es un sistema de control de versiones distribuido que utilizan los desarrolladores de software que contribuyen a un mismo proyecto o software. Básicamente ayuda a los usuarios a rastrear los diferentes cambios realizados en el software por diferentes usuarios.
Github es una plataforma que proporciona alojamiento y control de versiones para su código y cualquiera puede colaborar en cualquier proyecto en todo el mundo.
Cómo empezar a usar Github

Lo primero que tenemos que hacer es configurar el entorno, por lo que necesitamos descargar git. Para cualquier sistema operativo podemos descargarlo aqui 


Una vez que hayamos instalado correctamente git, podemos abrir la terminal y escribir el siguiente comando para comprobarlo. 

Después de esto podemos ir al sitio web…</span>

                    <span>Data Structure is a notable class that many Computer Sciences majors take in university. Learning this topic helps improve the way you store, organize and collect data in a given software or program. Also, many companies use data structures in their interview questions. I will present my top five ways to learn data structure. 
There are many different channels dedicated to teaching data structure. When I was taking Data Structure, the top two youtube channels I heavily depended on was Michael&#x27;s Sambol channel and mycodeschool channel. Sadly, both of the channels haven&#x27;t been updated in years. But they are still useful to this day.

                    <span>I have faced this issue that no article or no forum shows correct way to install firefox on debian based distros, or maybe I haven&#x27;t found such article, but anyways I figured out myself.
Step 1
firefox browser.
Step 2
Step 3
/opt directory.
sudo mv ~/Downloads/firefox /opt

Step 4
.desktop file in user&#x27;s applications directory
cd ~/.local/share/applications

You can name your firefox desktop file anything like I have installed firefox developer addition, so my file name is firefox-dev.desktop. But you can name it anything which is relevant.
touch firefox-dev.desktop
nano firefox-dev.desktop

Inside this file my configuration is something like this:
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding&#x3D;UTF-8
Version&#x3D;1.0
Type&#x3D;Application
Exec&#x3D;/opt/firefox/firefox
Name&#x3D;Firefox Developer Edition
Icon&#x3D;/opt/firefox/browser/chrome/icons/default/default128.png
Comment&#x3D;Custom definition for Firefox Developer Edition
Terminal&#x3D;fasle

Note:
You can see that location to execute firefox is in out /opt/firefox pointing to firefox executable file.
Icon for out firefox will be found in given location, you can choose any set of icons, whichever suits your need.</span>

                    <span>Hello Devs, in this article, I will walk you through the differences between using dot notation and bracket notation in JavaScript objects.
Consider the following object.

let animalsList &#x3D; {
  cow:{
    legs: 4,
    sound: &quot;moo&quot;,
  },
  cat:{
    legs: 4,
    sound: &quot;meow&quot;,
  },
};


We can use both dot and bracket notation to access the properties. Make sure that you enclose the key within quotes, when you use bracket notation.

console.log(animalsList.cat); //{ legs: 4, sound: &#x27;meow&#x27; }
console.log(animalsList[&quot;cat&quot;]); //{ legs: 4, sound: &#x27;meow&#x27; }


As you can see, dot notation has better readability, it is an advantage of using dot notation.
&quot;So, if we can use both dot notation and bracket notation to access object properties, and dot notation has better readability, why do we even have bracket notation?&quot;, you might ask.
Let&#x27;s say we have a function, and the key which we have to access is passed to the function as an argument.

function myFun(animal){
  console.log(animalsList.animal);
}

myFun(&quot;cow&quot;); 


The above code will print undefined. 
When we use dot notation, JavaScript searches for the key with the exact name we used after the dot( animal, in our case). Since the animalsList doesn&#x27;t have a property called &quot;animal&quot;, undefined is printed.
Let&#x27;s try bracket notation instead of dot notation.

function myFun(animal){
  console.log(animalsList[animal]);
}

myFun(&quot;cow&quot;);


The above code will work fine and print { legs: 4, sound: &#x27;moo&#x27; }, as &quot;animal&quot; will be replaced with the respective argument which was passed during function call.
To summarize, use bracket notation when you want to access property using variable, otherwise stick with dot notation.
I hope this article helped you. Happy coding!</span>

I started learning go a few months ago, because I wanted to write fast, safe, and performant applications. I began it by reading through An Introduction to Programming in Go by Caleb Doxsey. I&#x27;m a third of the way through, and I decided that I wanted to share the joy of learning go with everyone. Without furthe ado, let&#x27;s get started!
Golang, often shortened to go, is a programming language. It is used to write web servers, client applications, system programs, pretty much anything. It is a great programming language, suited to writing good code effortlessly.
Google, Uber, Twitch, and others.

                    <span>Sometimes you need to solve a problem, and you really don&#x27;t feel like doing it with bash. Recently I took it upon myself to replace an expensive-but-intelligent Gradle task with a cheap-but-dumb JVM app.1 The Gradle task took an average of 2min per build, and my team cumulatively spent 43 hours over the past month waiting for it to complete. The Kotlin app that replaces it takes about 300ms to complete and I project we&#x27;ll spend the next month cumulatively waiting on it less than 8 minutes. Since time is money, I&#x27;ve estimated this might save us $100,000 over the next 12 months.
This is not that story.2
It is instead the story of how to build such a thing with Gradle.  We&#x27;ll learn how to use the application and distribution plugins to build the app and bundle a distribution; how to use the s…</span>

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>
