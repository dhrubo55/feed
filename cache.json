You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.\nChanged: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention\nChanged: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)\nThank you @PiyushLosalka",

But, inspired by my friend’s nerd rage, I decided to learn more about why people do and don’t like arrow functions.\nArrow functions are a hotly debated topic in the JavaScrip community. Some people think you should use them almost exclusively, and others think you should never use them at all!\nWhile I’m biased towards using arrow functions because it’s how I learned, I’ll do my best to represent both s…",

          "description": "Introduction\n\n\nReact provides a very good and simple way to manage local states through state hooks but when it comes to global states the options available are overwhelming.\nReact itself provides the context API which many third party libraries for managing global state are built on top of it, but still the APIs built are not as simple and intuitive as state hooks, let alone the cons of using the context API to manage global state which we won't be discussing in this post, but there are plenty of articles talking about it.\nSo managing global states in react is still a problem with no clear solution yet.\nBut what if I tell you there might be a solution which is based on global variables?\nYes the global variables that you use every day in your code.\n\n\nThe concept of managing states is very …",

          "description": "Hey guys 👋, here's another side project I worked on in June. Hope you enjoy it.\nSo I made a decision earlier this year to at least create a project monthly on something I really like as a means to improve my skills, work on my creative side and have some fun, this is part of the June entry(s). Charity hunter was created as part of a 24hr hack hosted by sigma hacks from Jun 25 – 26, 2021, I thought of backdating this but it felt less genuine 🤷‍♂️ , so here it is, a couple days late:\nLive / Repo  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Inspiration 💭\n\n\nI wanted to make something to enable people to easily find trusted charities and provide aid to their different causes, so I came up with Charity hunter, it uses your location to find charities near you, also, lets you find specific themes/causes you want to support all from a vetted database of charities provided by GlobalGiving. It was a simple idea but I believe it can be very useful.\nReact & plain CSS\nGlobal Giving API\nFirebase Hosting\nGoogle Maps API\nThe notion task list used ⬇ *\n\n\n\nThe Initial UI design ⬇ *\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  What's Next ⏭\n\n\n\nMobile Responsiveness; since the goal is ease, this is first on the list.\nUI improvement; the UI needs a bit of work to make it more intuitive and crisp.\nSearch Filter; filter by more categories and toggles.\nCode Refactoring; some areas of code need to be adjusted to make contributing to this easier and to follow standard code principles.\nAny other feedback or feature request is alright.\nI believe this is something worth working on, and it's something that could help a ton of people. More ideas, more features, better UI / UX and more reach which can only be done when we all come together, the more contributors the better. So why don't you jump in and put some hands in the pot\n\nI hope you enjoyed this and maybe gained something from this short post. Looking forward to the next one.",

          "description": "What is Prisma?\n\n\nPrisma is one of the best database libraries I've ever used. In a nutshell, you write a schema, and Prisma can apply the changes to your database, and generate a Typescript client library custom-tailored to your databases.\nFor this example, I'll use a simple blog app. It has a User table, and an Article table. Users can have many Articles, and each Article only has one author.\nTo install Prisma, run yarn add prisma -D.\nIn a folder called prisma at the root of your project, you can create a file called schema.prisma. This is where the descriptions (or \"schemas\") of your tables will be stored.\nPrisma uses this file to apply changes to the database, and generate a custom client for us.\n\nYou can ignore the migrations folder for now.\nTo specify where your database will be, you…",
