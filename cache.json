It means using the inbuilt JavaScript methods and objects without any additional libraries or frameworks.\nSo why use VanillaJS instead of libraries or frameworks? Well, we gotta admit libraries like ReactJS are just amazing but VanillaJS is faster than any other JavaScript framework because it has fewer overheads.
