React Router is used for developing Single Page Web Applications. It is used to define multiple routes in the application. When a user types a specific URL into the browser, and if this URL path matches any 'route' inside the router file, the user will be redirected to that particular route.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Guys Ravi here...
Android Emulator for M1 is not available on stable releases yet and I am also waiting for Android Studio to fully support M1 macs so that I can use it for developing my React Native project. 
But!

Android Studio Preview has supported M1 chips pretty well so I am using that one to test my android app.
You can download Android Emulator for M1 from the below link:
https://github.com/google/android-emulator-m1-preview/releases/tag/0.3
1.Setup M1 Android Emulator:
https://youtu.be/3clEUFzXPjA

2.After Setting Android Emulator On Mac M1 edit your bash_profile. To edit it open your terminal and run below command
open ~/.bash_profile

Add this line to your bash_profile, and replace the user-name with your username
export PATH="$PATH:/Users/user-name/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools"


source ~/.bash_profile

3.Then In Terminal check available adb devices by running below command:
adb devices

It will show your Android Emulator

4.Now Create React Native Project by running below command
npx react-native init AndroidApp

5.Once the project is created, Go to your react-native Project then go to android directory Create a file with following name "local.properties".
Open the file and paste your Android SDK path like below:
sdk.dir = /Users/USERNAME/Library/Android/sdk


6.Now run your react native project by
npx react-native run-android

7.Now Your app will run in Android Emulator

If you have any question or facing any issue you can ask me.

Thanks for reading this post.]]></summary>

By combining features such as PostgreSQL's role-based grant system and row-level security policies with Graphile Engine's GraphQL look-ahead and plugin expansion technologies, PostGraphile ensures your generated schema is secure, performant and extensible.
There are two ways to setup a PostgreSQL database with Railway, through the dashboard or through the CLI.
Click dev.new and choose "Provision PostgreSQL" After the database is setup click "PostgreSQL" on the left and then choose "Connect". Copy and paste the PostgreSQL client command.

Basically modules are pieces of code that can be imported anywhere in your application. A module is really easily recognizable, as soon as you see the import or export keyword, you're dealing with a module.
So... pretty much everything is a module ?
What about the require keyword I've seen here and here ?
How do I use them ?
We'll cover everything from this point onward.
Grab a coffee, and let's get started.
As we can't really understand something without the knowledge of why it exist, we'll take a quick historical detour.
Waaaaay back in the days, nothing known as modules existed. But also, Javascript wasn't as widely used as it is today, it's only purpose was pretty much to add interactivity on your website.

From a technical view, HTML is superfuous: We can access the HTML-DOM-API directly to build the DOM. From a programmers view, there are good reasons to rethink the whole concept. 
Maybe it´s time for a new approach.
The Document Makeup Library (DML) is a new Javascript library that has just been released as Open Source. DML makes it increadibly easy to build complex web applications using just vanilla javascript (one language to rule them all...). It let´s you create DOM elements using the tags you are used to - not in html, but from within Javascript. h1() creates an <h1>-element, p() a <p> and so on. This makes it possible to "bypass" the traditional HTML-approach completely.…]]></summary>

  Html





<div class="container">
    <div class="item">A</div>
    <div class="item">B</div>
    <div class="item">C</div>
</div>


.container{
    width: 720px;
    height: 480px;
    background-color: blue;
}

.item{
    font-size: 18px;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 5px 10px;
    border: 1px solid green;
    background-color: orange;
}

.container{
    display: flex; /* flex box applied here */
    width: 720px;
    height: 480px;
    background-color: blue;
}

We can now add a ‘flex-direction’ property to the container and assign one of the following values:
flex-direction: row; - Aligns items horizontally, left to right. 
 
flex-direction: column; - Aligns items vertically, top to bottom.

flex-direction: row-reverse;- Aligns items horizontally, right to left.;`

flex-direction: column-reverse;- Aligns items vertically, bottom to top.

We can place the items at different positions along the container’s main axis by using the ‘justify-content’ property coupled with one of the following values:
justify-content: flex-start;

justify-content: flex-end;

justify-content: center;

justify-content: space-between;

justify-content: space-around;

justify-content: space-evenly;

We can place the items at different along the container’s cross axis by using the ‘align-items’ property coupled with one of the following values:
align-items: flex-start;

align-items: flex-end;

align-items: center;

align-items: strech;

For example, if you are a [former] Software Engineer (which is very common for early Tech startups), you are going to be involved in the design, marketing, management, sales, and even finance processes.

The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
But why do we need destructuring ?
let arr = [1,2,3,4]

let obj = {

Recently  I completed work on a tool called nlphoseGUIBuilder that allows creation of complex NLP pipelines visually, without writing a single line of code ! It uses Blockly to enable creation of NLP pipelines using drag and drop. 
Currently following operations are supported:
Sentiment Analysis (AFINN)
NER (Spacy)
Language Identification (FastText)
Chunking (NLTK)
Sentiment Analysis (Transformers)
Question Answering (Transformers)
Zero shot Classification (Transformers)
The tool generates a nlphose command that can be executed in a docker container to run the pipeline. These pipelines can process streaming text like tweets or static data like files. They can be executed just like normal shell command using nlphose.  Let me show you what I mean !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Automated testing is an important part of any software project, including testing for accessibility. There are already tools for linting and integration testing accessibility, but what about end-to-end testing with real assistive technology? Since I hadn’t seen this before, I set out to build Auto VO, a driver for the VoiceOver screen reader.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed 📺 Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<replace_with_channel_id>
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka]]></summary>

However, due to the bad feedback loop resulting from voice assistants can only solve simple user tasks such as setting an alarm or playing music.
