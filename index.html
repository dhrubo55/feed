                    <span>Hello everyone 👋 !! In this blog post, we will see how to implement Progressive Delivery with AWS AppMesh in EKS using Flagger. Before getting deep dive into the blog, let&#x27;s see some of the concepts behind it. - Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment, Progressive Delivery.
Continuous delivery — the capability of supplying artifacts such as binaries, container images, secrets, or runtime configurations in a safely automated, hands-off approach.
Continuous deployment — somewhat established, pulling said artifacts and launching them in a runtime environment such as Kubernetes, Amazon ECS, etc. At the time of publication, certain good practices such as immutable artifacts and multi-staged caching have been shared and adopted widely.
Progressive delivery is modern software development for …</span>

                    <span>While searching for a CI/CD solution for a side project of mine, I discovered the GitHub Secrets feature. Using GitHub Actions, you can setup automated builds triggered in various customizable ways. If part of your automation pipeline includes deployment or delivery to a third-party, you’re probably going to be using some kind of authorization token. Common knowledge dictates that storing super secret authorization files in plain text is a big no-no, so in comes GitHub Secrets to save the day!

GitHub Actions can be as simple or as complicated as you need them to be, but here’s an Action that runs a Bash script from the target repository whenever a commit is directly made to the main branch:

In this new article we will learn step by step how to deploy our web applications with ASP.NET (with a DotVVM project as an example) on an Ubuntu Server 20.04 virtual machine under the concept infrastructure as a service in Microsoft Azure. 
Given these considerations, here are the important points that we will review in this tutorial article: 
Create a virtual machine with a Linux distribution in Azure. 
Install the .NET environment and an Apache server on the virtual machine.
Publish the ASP.NET web application in Visual Studio 2019. 
Host the web application on the virtual machine.
Plus: Attach a database to the virtual machine. 
To start, we must have a subscription in Azure, if we do not have an account we can get a free one here: h…</span>

                    <span>Kedro is an unopinionated Data Engineering framework that comes with a somewhat opinionated template. It gives the user a way to build pipelines that automatically take care of io through the use of abstract DataSets that the user specifies through Catalog entries.  These Catalog entries are loaded,ran through a function, and saved by Nodes.  The order that these Nodes are executed are determined by the Pipeline, which is a  DAG.  It&#x27;s the runner&#x27;s job to manage the execution of the Nodes.

While it’s not in widespread use today, it has the potential to become a very useful tool in many different industries. Quantum computing outperforms classical computing in many different ways, which means it can be used to help solve certain types of complex problems. Today, we’ll explore some of the basic aspects of quantum computing, such as qubits, quantum physics, use cases, and more.
We’ll cover:
Quantum computing and quantum computers
Quantum computers vs classical computers

The role of quantum physics
Quantum computing use cases

                    <span>Django is a python web programming framework, which allows us to dynamically generate HTML and CSS for the backend of our website. Django combines the static web pages created using HTML and CSS with the endless possibilites of the programming language python, leading us to built dynamic web applications.
Django will allow us to write python code which will dynamically generate HTML and CSS.
It stands for Hyper-Text-Transfer-Protocol, which is the protocol for how messages are going to be sent back and forth over the internet.
Example of a HTTP request method:-

Get tells us that we want to get that particular page. / simply indicates that we are requesting for the home page. HTTP/1.1 is the version of HTTP which we are using. Host tells us what URL we are trying to access the web-page for.
Example of an HTTP response:-


To start a django project in the current directory, run this command:-
django-admin startproject project_name

The short intro to some starter files made by Django is given below:-
manage.py :- We will use this file to be able to execute commands on this django project.


settings.py :- If we want to change some settings to add features to our application or make modifications to how our application behaves. 


urls.py :- This is the table of contents of all the urls on our web applications which ulitmately a user can visit.</span>

                    <span>Coding in JavaScript without an understanding of closures is like trying to speak English without an understanding of grammar rules — you might be able to get your ideas across, but probably a bit awkwardly.
Closure is one of important concepts in JavaScript. It is widely discussed and still confused concept. Let&#x27;s understand what the closure is.
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
Lexical scope is the ability for a function scope to access variables from the parent scope. We call the child function…</span>

                    <span>Hi there, In Linear Search or Sequential Search every element in the array is checked, and if the match is found then the element index is returned, otherwise the search continues till the last element.
Visual learners can follow my YouTube video. 





  
  
  Lets write some code


always remember that array indexing starts from Zero - &#x27;0&#x27;
const numbers &#x3D; [2, 4, 67, 8, 44, 6, 12];

Now, lets write a function to apply linear search algorithm to above array.
function linearSearch(array, num) {
  for (let i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {
    if (array[i] &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; num) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}

linearSearch(numbers, 8); // returns index 4
linearSearch(numbers, 28); // since 28 is not there, returns -1 

// Save the file and run it using Node.JS
// Open terminal and give command: …</span>

Have you ever seen a 3D object rendered on a web page? Of course, you have, and chances are it was made using Javascript. But creating 3D objects with pure JavaScript requires a large amount of code, and might now always work in React environments. Not to say it isn&#x27;t possible! However, with the implementation of react-3d-cube, you can easily add the 3D cube animation into any of your React applications. 
This tutorial was written to make you comfortable with react-3d-cube, but also to get you familiar with adjusting your code as needed.



Assuming you already have a React app made, install react-3d-cube.


npm i react-3d-cube

                    <span>Injection: Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.


Broken Authentication: Application functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities temporarily or permanently.


Sensitive Data Exposure: Many web applications and APIs do not properly protect sensitive data, such as financial, healthcare, and PII. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct…</span>
