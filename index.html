                    <span>GraphQL, is a technology for fetching and mutating data that makes you wonder why you were building your servers to be REST endpoints for so long. In case you are just meeting it for the first time, grapQL is a runtime and query language that we can use to describe a format for our data and how to get that data. GraphQL is not tied to any specific programming language or database and as such it can be used with any database or language of your choosing so you don&#x27;t need to learn anything from scratch. GraphQL is just a technology that bridges different parts of your application, this image can give you a hint of what i mean.

                    <span>Introduction


In programming, it&#x27;s important to make sure that your code is readable, maintainable, extendable and easily testable. One of the ways that we can improve all of these factors in our code is by using interfaces.
This article is aimed at developers who have a basic understanding of OOP (object oriented programming) concepts and using inheritance in PHP. If you know how to use inheritance in your PHP code, this article should hopefully be understandable.
In basic terms, interfaces are just descriptions of what a class should do. They can be used to ensure that any class implementing the interface will include each public method that is defined inside it.
Interfaces can be:
Used to define public methods for a class.
Used to define constants for a class.
Interfaces cannot be:

                    <span>During Gatsby page development, when you hit a page that doesn&#x27;t exist, you encounter a screen similar to the one below.

If you created a custom 404 page, for example in src/pages/404.js, you can click the Preview custom 404 page to display it. Entering the /404 route will do the job as well.
In production, however, the 404 page doesn&#x27;t get handled by itself unless you use a dedicated hosting service for Gatsby pages. That&#x27;s because Gatsby&#x27;s development server is no longer present. The production bundle is just a bunch of static files. Making use of a web server (like nginx) to serve the production page forces you to configure the error pages yourself.
Disclaimer: the following nginx configuration is pretty basic, don&#x27;t use it in production.
Let&#x27;s assume your blog is hosted on the personalblog.com domain and is served from the /var/www/blog directory on port 80.
server {
        listen 80;
        root /var/www/blog;
        server_name personalblog.com www.personalblog.com;
        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ &#x3D;404;
        }
}

After entering a route that doesn&#x27;t exist in your production Gatsby site, nginx displays its default 404 error page.

Adding the error_page 404 /404; line makes nginx redirect to the /404 route in case of a 404 error. Your custom Gatsby 404 page will be displayed.
server {
        listen 80;
        root /var/www/blog;
        server_name personalblog.com www.personalblog.com;
        error_page 404 /404;
        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ &#x3D;404;
        }
}

Visit the error_page docs section to explore the rest of the configuration options.</span>

Last time we discussed the WHY, now it&#x27;s time to discussed the HOW. This series is based on python-pptx library, a small and great library but it&#x27;s not most beginner friendly, we will try to make more friendly in this part.
After installing the library pip install python-pptx, things maybe overwhelming if you navigate the library&#x27;s documentation, to save you the trouble I will break down what you will need from the library, and once you can do simple template population, you may feel free to delve into the docs and explore more cool stuff!
The first thing you need to do is to import Presentation(), this is the core of what we will do, you can open a copy of your template using this function into a variable to use later on. The argument the function needs is the name/path of the tem…</span>

                    <span>Programming is not something that readily comes into mind when thinking about art, but many applications of programming allow for artistic expression. There is even a field of programming called creative coding where the goal is not to create something functional but rather expressive.
Even though programming for art has been a thing for a while, it used to be fairly inaccessible as it required deep knowledge in the field. Take Demoscene, for example. Demoscene is a computer art subculture that has been around since the 1980s. It involves creating audiovisual presentations, called demos, that are not only artistic creations but also technical achievements.




It can be challenging, even for a programmer, to understand how a demo is implemented. That is not to say other fields of art are d…</span>

In a complex web application, with several components needing data, odds are that redundant API calls will be made. You may imagine even a simple e-commerce page: the user could want to see an article, then a second one, and then go back to the first. In such a case it&#x27;s a sure bet that the app would redo its previous API calls, to essentially get the very same information it already had. Caching by the browser may help, for sure, but that also depends on the remote server providing the appropriate headers, and that may not always happen. So, we want to do something in our code that will complement whatever caching is done by the browser, if any, but ensure the best performance for the user in any case.

Do you use Slack for team communication? We love it — and so do lots of teams around the world! Slack helps keep your team on the same page. It’s a space for you to collaborate with your colleagues and make decisions faster.
But have you ever felt overwhelmed by the constant stream of information Slack gives you? As your team grows, Slack becomes more crowded with streams, channels, and conversations. It becomes a never-ending source of noise, and hard to keep up with. With so many updates, messages, and files, it’s easy to get lost in the noise.
Do you sometimes struggle with the feeling of FOMO — “fear of missing out” when it comes to your Slack messages? That someone was about to send you an important Slack message and you might miss taking action on it? I k…</span>

Let&#x27;s open any code editor of your choice and navigate to our index.jsx, this is where all action will be taking place. For now, let&#x27;s leave index.html and index.css alone.

Let&#x27;s explain this code we wrote above.

In the code above, we imported React library from our node_modules folder (you can head there yourself, and you will see a folder named react), this is necessary and will be imported on every page we write some React code.

In its simplest use case, the  tag gives us an &quot;open/close&quot; toggle control that shows the contents of the  tag when closed; and all its contents when openend by clicking on it.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
