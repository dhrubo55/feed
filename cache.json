          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

          "description": "In the last article, we saw that at its core, Javascript is synchronous (statements in our code are executed one after the other and we need to wait for a statement to finish execution before moving to the next) and the behaviour of its functions is blocking (if we have an expensive method, until that method doesn't return, no other block of code can run). \nWhen having complex programs, this behaviour will create problems (in the context of browsers, this means that our browser will be stuck until the blocking function finishes execution). Fortunately, there are ways to fix this by writing asynchronous code. \nASYNCHRONOUS\nIn Javascript, we can implement an asynchronous behaviour in a number of ways by using:\ncallback functions\ntimeouts and intervals\npromises\nasync/ await (which is just syntactic sugar on top of promises)\nThe main benefits we gain from using asynchronous programming is that our applications will have improved performance and responsiveness. For example, async programming will help deliver a responsive UI to the users while running a computationally expensive operation, at the same time.\nIn the next article we'll talk about callbacks and how we can use them to write asynchronous code.\n*Image sources: James Harrison/ @jstrippa on Unsplash",

          "description": "If you're working with NodeJS applications, you probably has process.env.VARIABLE statements all around your code base. The most simple method to configure an application is installing dotenv and creating that lovely .env file on the root folder of your project.\nThis approach, however, has some pitfalls and is error prone. What if you don't set that process.env port? You'll probably have a default value (maybe 3000?), but you will need to run your application to discover such type of thing.\nThat same problem has been solved by typescript for almost anything. When you have the help of static typing, you can discover some errors a lot faster. That said, how can you use Typescript to have a type-safe way to access configurations?\nTake a look at that short snippet:\nexport class EnvironmentService<Environment> {\n\n  public constructor(\n   private readonly variables: Environment\n  ) {\n    // some logic to assign process.env to this.variables\n    // you can use, for instance, \n    this.variables = Joi.attempt<Environment>(process.env))\n  }\n\n  public get<T>(name: keyof Environment) {\n    return <T><unknown>this.variables[name];\n  }\n}\n\nIn a nutshell,\nFirst, you need to define an interface for you environment;\nThen, you do pass it as a type parameter to the EnvironmentService class when instantiating a new object;\nFinally, use something like class-validator, Joi or you library of choice to assert if the process.env object has all required variables and assign its value to the variables attribute;\nAfter those simple steps, you can use the method get to fetch all possible environment variables with the help of typescript to guide your choice - and if you need, you can cast the value to some desired type:\n\nThat's all folks! If you liked that simple content, don't forget to comment and share with someone you might help. Also, that's my first attempt to write something in english: if you see something wrong, just message me on Twitter (@dotmendes\n).\nTypescript Handbook: Keyof",
