        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this tutorial we’ll be building a simple accordion component for use in React applications. This type of component is useful for things like FAQ’s when you want to break up a large amount of content into smaller more consumable pieces.
Here’s what the completed component will look like:

Let’s get started by using Create React App to setup the development environment:
npx create-react-app react-accordion

Next create a new Accordion.js file in the /src directory with the following code:
import React, { useState } from "react";
import "./accordion.css";

const Accordion = ({ heading, content }) => {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
  return (
    <li className="accordion-item">

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[User Authentication can be a difficult module to implement and manage in web and mobile applications. There's a lot to consider when it comes to security, JWTs, salting, and much more.
Fortunately, this can be accomplished instantly with the <Auth /> component (<NativeAuth /> for React Native) from the 'easybase-react' package.
The final result will look like this:
export default function App() {
  return (
    <EasybaseProvider ebconfig={ebconfig}>
      <Auth>
        <h2>You're In!</h2>
      </Auth>
    </EasybaseProvider>
  );
}


Create a free account at easybase.io and make a Project. From there, download your ebconfig token and place it in your React project's src/ folder. Install the package with npm i easybase-react.

Import this config file, along with EasybaseProvider and Auth:
import ebconfig from './ebconfig';
import { EasybaseProvider, Auth } from 'easybase-react';

Wrap your entire component in EasybaseProvider and place Auth inside of it. Children of Auth will only be loaded and displayed if a user is currently signed in.
export default function App() {
  return (
    <EasybaseProvider ebconfig={ebconfig}>
      <Auth>
        <h2>You're In!</h2>
      </Auth>
    </EasybaseProvider>
  );
}

Run your project and create an example account by clicking 'No Account? Sign Up':

This will sign you in! The <Auth /> component is highly customizable when it comes to CSS and forms, read here for customization.
To sign out, import useEasybase and call the signOut function:
function User() {
  const { signOut } = useEasybase()
  return <button onClick={signOut}>Sign Out</button>
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <EasybaseProvider ebconfig={ebconfig}>
      <Auth>
        <User />
      </Auth>
    </EasybaseProvider>
  );
}

All users will appear in the Easybase interface, under the Users tab:

.getContext was something that I had never done before and I definitely want to do more in depth research on the different aspects of it. This exercise also used event listeners and functions to listen for the events needed to draw onto the created canvas' x and y axis. This exercise also utilized mothereffinghsl to get the color gradiant hue for our drawn line working in conjunction with the event listeners.

Loved this overview. I learned a few things about DevTools that I did not know before as well as all the varieties of console. that can be used. I had mostly used console.log() and console.dir() before and was surprised at just how many there are and the variety of ways they can be used! I feel like I've been missing out not knowing about console.table()!!

This exercise worked with checkboxes and using the shift key to be able to select multiple checkboxes at a time. This was done by programmatically setting the boxes to checked with JavaScript until you click the last one. Until the last one clicked is selected, our flag variable gets set to false which makes this functionality work both when selecting from the bottom to the top top or vice versa, by setting the variable equal to this or to lastChecked. The variable is declared with the let keyword because it is a variable that can change.]]></summary>

In this article, you will learn how to build a simple web application with Vue.js, query your data from Sanity, and make it a Progressive Web Application (PWA) by installing the PWA plugin. In making it a PWA, the app will be able to be installed on mobile phones.
You can see the deployed app here and see the final code here.

To understand this guide you should have:
Basic understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript
At least little experience or knowledge of Vue.js


Node and npm or yarn installed on your computer
Basic knowledge of how the terminal

Meu primeiro dia de trabalho foi bem interessante, ainda não tínhamos testado o projeto em um computador Mac com Apple Silicon (M1), com isso, tivemos um erro subindo o projeto. 
Uma informação que nos ajudará a entender o problema é que, com essa nova plataforma teremos o macOS baseado em arm64, seus simuladores também serão executados em arm64, ao contrário da atual arquitetura x86/64 baseada na Intel.
O projeto do trabalho, que havia sido criado com arquitetura x64, tem algumas dependências que não suportam a nova arquitetura dos MacBooks, então foi preciso mexer em uma configuração.
Como podemos ver abaixo, foi assim que ficou o Build Settings após fazer as alterações, fomos em Excluded Architectures, depois em Debug e Release adicionamos a arquitetura que queremos excluir quando subirmos o projeto no simulador (Any iOS Simulator).

Nesse vídeo eu mostro como configurei, porém em outro projeto que estava mexendo. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3Cmcyqbvxg
Lembrando que eu não rodo o projeto em um celular, e sim no simulador do Xcode mesmo.
Fazendo isso, pode acontecer com que o build fique mais lento, porque ele praticamente faz a transcrição do código com a arquitetura x64 (Intel) para a arm64 (Apple Silicon), mas isso resolveu o problema, já que iremos evitar as dependências que não suportam essa nova arquitetura de nos impedir de subir o projeto. 
O M1 consegue executar códigos feitos na arquitetura Intel com o Rosetta 2. Um link interessante sobre isso aqui 
E um agradecimento final ao meu líder que conseguiu me explicar isso pacientemente e me ajudar a solucionar o problema. Obrigada, Felipe!]]></summary>

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.]]></summary>

Problem Description
Problem Explanation
Solution


Modeling the Solution
The specific problem we will be walking through, is problem Leetcode #695: Max Area of Island. The direct problem description found on Leetcode is:
You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
