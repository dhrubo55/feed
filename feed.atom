  Key Concepts


I don't intend to leave behind the many developers that are just getting started. So, here's the general breakdown that you HAVE TO know.
Container is just as it sounds, a box to separate out resources used by it. This is somewhere between running apps directly in your host vs running in a VM (Virtual Machine). In a VM only the hardware resources are shared. However, in docker the OS kernel is shared. This does mean that the security of your container can be compromised if you let it (That's a whole another beast of its own, so I'll leave that out. Yes, this does mean you should not just pull down some random image and run exactly as the writer tells you to 😭…]]></summary>

Our first approach was to find every usage of money attributes and parse them with BigDecimal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a "pseudo" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
