                    <span>Hello, I&#x27;m Aya Bouchiha, 
this is the part 2 of 5 useful python string methods.
part 1
capitalize(): this string method converts to uppercase the first letter of the first word in the specified string.
first_name &#x3D; &quot;aya&quot;

print(first_name.capitalize()) # Aya

isalpha(): checks if all string&#x27;s characters are alphabets letters [A-z].
print(&#x27;AyaBouchiha&#x27;.isalpha())   # True
print(&#x27;Aya Bouchiha&#x27;.isalpha())  # False
print(&#x27;Aya-Bouchiha&#x27;.isalpha())  # False
print(&#x27;AyaBouchiha 1&#x27;.isalpha()) # False
print(&#x27;Aya Bouchiha!&#x27;.isalpha()) # False

isdigit(): checks if all string&#x27;s characters are digits.
print(&#x27;100&#x27;.isdigit())     # True
print(&#x27;12a&#x27;.isdigit())     # False
print(&#x27;100 000&#x27;.isdigit()) # False
print(&#x27;+212-6000-00000&#x27;.isdigit()) # False
print(&#x27;12a&#x27;.isdigit()) # False

                    <span>Introduction:


Building a design system is a progressive and abstractive approach to maintaining a consistent and cost-efficient components library that follows a specific styling guide and is sharable across multiple products. A design system has always been associated with designers but now it‚Äôs becoming critical for frontend developers to understand it from the technology perspective.
In this article, I will share some of the tools I used to successfully build a design system in React. Of course, before building the library, we require the designer‚Äôs expertise to develop the brand‚Äôs look and feel, user experience, style guide, etc.
One of the essential parts of providing a design system library is to be able to have an independent React components solution that can be published and use‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Today many applications use QR codes.
QR codes are used for many different purposes, like tickets, restaurant menus, payments, sharing a contact or a URL, etc.
A QR code may seem magical to non-tech users, but it is actually very simple. QR codes are simply a different way to write text: instead of using the normal alphabet, that is easily read by humans, we use different signs that are easily read by a machine. 
Since you can write any text inside a QR code, you can also write a URL for example. URLs are one of the most common contents of QR codes. A mobile device that scans a QR code, reads the text, and finds a URL, may decide to open that link.
For example, if you have a restaurant menu online you can simply take the URL of the menu and convert it into a QR code: in this way users that‚Ä¶</span>

You can continue to use that product for a longer time. Thereby the product becomes cheaper to own in the long term basis despite they can be expensive to buy.
Heck, I can even have the option to don&#x27;t do it myself. Which I can find skilled craftsman or company to do the repairs for me. 
This spawned a cottage industry surrounding the product or a brand displaying their care for the customers. Bringing them tons of good will and brand loyalty like some of these great examples are Allen Edmonds Recrafting Services or Red Wings Repair. 
This was precisely why I personally own 2 Allen Edmonds dress shoes for that specific reason. Because I could repair these shoes in my own country (Singapore) or ship them back to the US even when Allen Edmonds doesn&#x27;t sell their shoes in my country.

These are a series of client-directed notes that I put together following a really poorly-planned project with the intent of communicating how to do better next time. Will each of these items seem obvious to us as developers? Certainly. How about to our clients and designers that are directing the work? Too often, not at all. Read on --&gt;
Tl;dr - Put together a clear design that is complete before the development work gets started. Give all of those details to your developer up front. If they ask questions before or during, give a complete answer. They should not have to make any assumptions or guesses unless you have hired them to do that planning and/or design work in addition to development.

Some modern development practices are easiest to understand from a historical perspective. 
Things started a certain way, and then steps were added or removed as conditions changed. If you don&#x27;t know the backstory, then the current state of the world can seem arbitrary and confusing. Git branching is like that.
I&#x27;m going to explain various git branching strategies with a story. We will start with something straightforward and add complexity as we go. Eventually, we will end up back simple again.
I hope that explaining things this way will give you a deeper understanding of when to use specific branching and merging strategies. So instead of telling you how to cherry-pick a bug fix into a hotfix branch using GitFlow work, I can describe the conditions that would lead to adopting‚Ä¶</span>

The K-means algorithm is a method for dividing a set of data points into distinct clusters, or groups, based on similar attributes. It is an unsupervised learning algorithm which means it does not require labeled data in order to find patterns in the dataset. 
K-means is an approachable introduction to clustering for developers and data scientists interested in machine learning. In this article, you will learning how to implement k-means entirely from scratch and gain a strong understanding of the k-means algorithm.

Git is basically putting the current version of your project in a time capsule. 
git status command shows the files that are untracked, meaning the files just created by you.
git add -A.
git status again.
You bury the time capsule using git commit -m &quot;First Commit&quot;
In order to push your commit the changes to the online repository, use git remote add origin https://github.com/angelayoon/PETase-igemcolab-database.git Origin is the default name of the master branch and you can change its name. Then git push -u origin master push the changes to the cloud repository(origin) on master branch.

                    <span>Smart Contracts work in reactive mode. Once deployed in the Blockchain, they go to a hibernation state until some work needs to be done. When the work is completed, they go to bed again. They basically react to transactions by executing code.
On the contrary, Smart Contracts in proactive mode, which don&#x27;t really exist in reality but can be emulated, watch for different conditions to wake up themselves and do their job without intervention. For example, a contract that runs automatically when it detects a price fluctuation or when a given date or time is reached.
These contracts require the intervention of an external agent or worker that is constantly pinging the contract to verify whether one of the conditions to run was met. Those conditions should be checked in one or more view methods ‚Ä¶</span>
