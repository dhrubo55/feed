Azure Private Link service is the reference to your own service that is powered by Azure Private Link. Your service that is running behind Azure Standard Load Balancer can be enabled for Private Link access so that consumers to your service can access it privately from their own VNets. Your customers can create a private endpoint inside their VNet and map it to this service.
In todays tutorial we will look into an interesting use case for this service, in how we can connect an external source to consume an API management service (internal VNET mode) from an external non-peered VNET. As depicted in the following diagram:

Note: The source or entry point where we will place our private endpoint can be in a network that is in a completely different region…]]></summary>

-> ##REST(Representational State Transfer) and GraphQL are two API design styles that serve the same purpose: transferring data over internet protocols including HTTP. ... However, REST is an architectural pattern, whereas GraphQL is a query language
1) Rest has Multiple End points, where as GraphQL has one endpoint !

2) Both generally give the Data back in JSON format

3) Both are Stateless: 
4) Rest APIs are more flexible, whereas GraphQL only works with POST !

5) In GraphQL you can be more detailed about the kind of data you want to fetch, but thing is not applicable in REST APIs as it fetches all the data available

6) In REST because of its tendency to pull all the data it brings a huge amount of data which is unnecessary to the client !
In total in my opinion both have their own benefits, if you are new to APIs, then go with REST APIs]]></summary>

In simple words, its a fancy way of saying 'overloading () operator' as Functors or simply 'using objects as functions' . If you don't know what operator overloading is, don't worry we will go through it. If you already know what operator overloading is, skip to Functors .
Just like you add two numbers you can add 2 objects using this concept. It is simply overloading a operator to work with our user defined objects rather than just predefined objects.
int a=5,b=3,c=a+b;
myObject objA(10);
myObject objB(20);
myObject objC=objA+objB;

Here as you add 2 integers to c, you are adding 2 object values and storing it in ObjC. If you directly compile the above code, that will…]]></summary>

"Exceptions should be rare. Throwing and catching exceptions is slow relative to other code flow patterns. Because of this, exceptions shouldn't be used to control normal program flow."
Bom, de acordo com a documentação do framework, você deve evitar, ao máximo, fazer o lançamento de exceções como:
throw new Exception("Throwing some random exception here");

Principalmente dentro dos hot code paths, que são, basicamente, trechos (fluxos) da sua aplicação que são executados com muita frequência, como por exemplo: validações.
Para exemplificar, vamos imaginar que você precise construir uma web api, que deve verificar cada requisição recebida e validar se a mesma atende ou não às regras de negócio.

Muitas vezes é o maior obstáculo para quem quer começar a palestrar, porque não basta enviar para a comissão organizadora, seu C4P precisa se destacar dentre os demais e ser escolhido.
Aqui, mais importante do que saber quem é você é saber se você tem background para falar do assunto que você se propõe.  Tenha em mente que você não precisa ser especialista, mas um frontend falando de construção de banco de dados faz tanto sentido quanto um neurocirurgião falando de problemas ósseos no joelho.
Pode ser marqueteiro aqui. Você tem pouco mais de 50 caracteres para tentar chamar a atenção das pessoas do evento, mas não fuja do assunto: ele precisa dizer de forma clara o assunto que você vai abordar.
Sabe quando você lê a sinopse de um livro ou de um filme e ela te atrai tanto que você só consegue parar de pensar nisso? O seu resumo aqui tem essa função. É aqui que a sua palestra irá se destacar. Seu resumo deve ser breve (tente se limitar a dois tweets, algo em torno de 550 caracteres), e mais que isso: deve fazer com que a comissão pelo menos queira ler o seu outline.
Aqui é o momento de colocar em prática o que você aprendeu nas aulas de redação do ensino médio. Tente estruturar seu outline como se ele fosse uma dissertação: introdução, desenvolvimento e conclusão. 
Nem todo evento possui a mesma estrutura, portanto, leia com atenção o que eles pedem na submissão. Tente também pedir ajuda a um amigo ou mentor, opiniões externas sempre ajudam.

Isn't it annoying when you've got file A opened and you want to open file B but when you click file B, file B does open but file A closes? You might double click file B to open in a new tab but does it disappoint you sometimes like it did to me? To overcome this problem, search for "workbench.editor.enablePreview" in your settings and uncheck the option. From now onwards, VS Code will always open files in a new tab.
