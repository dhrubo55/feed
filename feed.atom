I want to share an overview of my project as well as the two parts of the project that I struggled with but ultimately learned the most from.
Before I get into my project, let’s break down what an API is. API stands for “Application Programming Interface” and is an intermediary between two applications so that they can communicate with each other. 
Companies (like Google) or organizations (like Governments) use API’s to share information or functionality with us so we can use the data to build projects. There are free API’s out there open to an…]]></summary>

Decision trees are a way to model conditional logic in a clear and composable way. Although commonly used in machine learning, they can be just as useful in more "typical" use cases which we will explore in this article.
This article will provide a brief introduction into trees as a data structure and decision trees as a tool, as well as their application in software development.
We will create a binary decision tree in JavaScript step-by-step and apply it to decide whether a value is a positive number, negative number, zero, or not a number at all.

The idea was pretty simple; a meme-driven chat room and a live price chart for each cryptocurrency. I was assigned to create the backend for the project, and my friend would make the web client.
I set three requirements for myself before starting to work on the server. First and foremost, I wanted to get the MVP out as soon as possible. Secondly, I wanted to make the server as lightweight as possible to just leave it running on a cheap VM. Lastly, I wanted to design the architecture to allow for easy scaling if the shit coin investors decide to make another stupid decision and use our application.
The first step was to think of the entire server as …]]></summary>

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>

Thinking that maybe some more people can go through the same simple stress, combining with the idea that knowledge does not occupy space and with the old desire that I have to write for you, I decided to write this short post that can help several people, just like me and use him as a pilot here in the medium.

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a "pseudo" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
