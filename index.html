                    <span>Hey everyone! I recently built an example website using Next.js and Web3Modal. For those of you who don&#x27;t know, Web3Modal is a simple way to connect your website to a Web3 / Ethereum wallet.
This is essential when building a decentralized application (dApp) because you need a wallet to interact with the Ethereum application.
Here is the example site: http://web3modal-example.vercel.app
Here is the source code: https://github.com/ChangoMan/web3modal-example
In order for the Web3Modal to work in your browser, you&#x27;ll need the MetaMask Chrome extension, or a WalletConnect compatible wallet.
I was going to create a full blog post explaining how everything worked, but wasn&#x27;t sure if anyone would be interested.
If you would like a more in depth explanation of the source code, let me know in the comments down below! Thanks for looking!</span>

                    <span>Next.js uses 4 rendering strategies to build, deliver and render a React Single Page App (SPA):
1. Static-Site Generation (SSG)
2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
3. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
4. Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
This is the easiest and most complete cheat sheet to quickly understand how Next.js page rendering strategies works. Moreover, this unique cheat sheet clearly reveals how each strategy influences the Core Web Vitals signals: TTFB, FP, FCP, LCP, TBT and TTI.
Detailed explanations are also included to help you choose the right page rendering strategy for all use cases and thus create speedy Web applications that Google and visitors love.

In this second part of our Passkeys series, we will be modifying Apple&#x27;s Shiny iOS app to make use of the same Passkeys (aka WebAuthn credentials) that we created with our web app from part one.
So far we saw that the Passkeys are automatically synced between your Apple devices and you could use them in Safari with the web app. Now it is time to make them accessible in native iOS apps as well.
Remember: This will allow you to register to a website with Touch ID in Safari, then download the app on your iPhone, and sign in to that app again with Touch ID or Face ID without creating and using a password at all. It also works the other way around, of course.
What are Passkeys again, you ask? It&#x27;s a brand new technology for secure passwordless authentication introduced by Apple at WWDC2…</span>

Introducción 


Al instalar cualquier versión de Node.js podemos contar con módulos que vienen por defecto en su core y por ende pueden ser utilizados de inmediato. Ahora bien hay un montón de estos módulos y estudiarlos todos desde el vamos es algo estupido (a mi criterio) por ello, recomiendo aprender el funcionamiento general de los más importantes y a medida que prosigas con tu aprendizaje de Node podrás profundizar más sobre estos módulos.
Un módulo básico y bastante sencillo de usar es el módulo path y a continuación les mostraré 4 métodos que opino usar casi siempre que requieras este módulo.

                    <span>Mobx-state-tree?


From the mobx-state-tree docs:
MobX is a state management &quot;engine&quot;, and MobX-State-Tree gives it structure and common tools you need for your app.
This post will help you to create a useStore hook to use MST in functional components in a React project.
Note: this post will be written in TypeScript.
First things first, let&#x27;s create our &quot;root store&quot; (this will be our store that will hold our of other stores - more on that later)
/// src/stores/rootStore.ts

import { types } from &#x27;mobx-state-tree&#x27;;

export const rootStore &#x3D; types
  .model({})
  .create({});

From MST, we import the types. This allows us to create a &quot;model&quot;, which will hold our data, as well as computed data, and actions to update our data.
To use our hook in our React app, let&#x27;s utilize React&#x27;s Context API …</span>

                    <span>In just 3 simple steps, you can use Kool to start a new NestJS application running in a local Docker development environment.
Kool is a free, open source CLI tool that makes local development with Docker super easy. Kool CLI will level up your development workflow, and help you and your team improve the way you develop and deploy cloud native applications.
If you haven&#x27;t done so already, you first need to install Docker and the Kool CLI.
If you already have kool installed, make sure you&#x27;re running the latest version:
$ kool self-update

Use the kool create command to create your new NestJS project.
$ kool create nestjs my-project

Under the hood, this command will run nest new my-project to install NestJS using a customized Kool Docker Image: kooldev/node:14-nest.

We will be chatting with:
Jonan Scheffler
Carmen Kolodziej
Randel Moore

In a typical Code School Twitch stream, these folks answer questions about tech. 
We would love to hear from the DEV community. What questions do you have for us? 
What do you want to know about entering tech?
What other tech topics are you interested in? 
We will be answering your questions on Wednesday July 21st at 1pm ET/ 5pm UTC on thePracticalDev Twitch stream.

To hide a DOM element, you don&#x27;t need JavaScript. A native HTML attribute is enough hidden. The effect is similar to adding a style display: none;. The element simply disappears from the page.
This paragraph is not visible on the page, it is hidden from the HTML.

Of course, this trick won&#x27;t work with pseudo-elements.
Are you familiar with the inset CSS property? This is an abbreviated version for the familiar top, left, right and bottom. By analogy with the short syntax margin of the or property padding, you can set all offsets for an element in one line.
// Before
div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
