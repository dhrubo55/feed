Every device that connects to an internet network has an IP address, which means there are billions of IP addresses that exist. Today, we’re going to discuss IP addresses, how they work, static IP vs dynamic IP, and more.
We'll cover:
What is an IP address?
How does an IP address work?
Static IP addresses
Dynamic IP addresses
Static IP vs dynamic IP
Wrapping up and next steps





An Internet Protocol address, or IP address, is a unique identifier assigned to every device on a TCP/IP network. The Internet Protocol is the set of rules that outlines how data should be transported across the internet or local networks. IP addresses help identify devices …]]></summary>

I am writing this article to help people who are beginners or at intermediate level, so I will try to explain everything in the simplest way possible. Let's begin!
Execution context is a box that is created every time a javascript code is executed. The box is divided into two parts : "memory creation" and "code execution".
Lets take a simple code to understand what goes inside these parts of execution context box.

If you missed the fun live, don't worry- you can watch the replay here on YouTube, and in the embedded video below!




On this episode we cover:
5:20 Chloe tells us about an AI/ML talk she did this weekend where she mentioned Beep Boop 🤖💕


9:20 Previously on Beep Boop... we catch folks up on what they missed last episode! 🔁


14:17 We introduce what we'll be working on this week, a Microsoft Learn module where we'll learn how to create a web app that uses data to make decisions on the basketball court 🏀 


15:08 One of our awesome viewers tells us about a VS Code extension that rainbow-ifies CSV files! 🌈📁


16:20 A refresher on what tools you'll need to download to follow along with this session - VS Code, an Azure account, and a few other bits and bobs ☁️🧵


18:04 Now that our data is squeaky clean 🧼, let's double check that we've set up our local environment


25:14 We merge the two datasets, and add identifiers to our DataFrame so that we know who's who 👀🐰


30:38 We start our new machine learning adventure by making a model, and calculating some standard deviations ➗🤓


43:32 First glimpse of our LIVE web app that we just made together! 😳💻


50:45 We learn about the Code Tour extension in VS Code and how it can guide you through adding the JavaScript to your web app 👩🏽‍💻


55:55 Franklin gives us the scoop on how he feels about creating basketball game simulations with the Tune Squad 🐶🦴



Did you have fun? Check out Beep Boop 4: Add AI to Your Web App where we add even more cool features to our web app - see ya then, friends!]]></summary>

Triggering any external process
Calling any other functions with side-effects
