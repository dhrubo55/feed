        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heeeeey guys, quick tip for those of you who need to deploy your app, there are several ways to deploy your app for free, but what I like the most is Netlify because it's so simple and fast:
1- Once logged in, click on
New site from Git

2- Choose where your code is stored:

3- Choose your repository (GitHub):

4- He will ask to set up your build information inBase directory you must put the path to your main page,, Build command this is where you put the command that will generate your project build, I always put it CI= npm run build
CI = <b>CI</b> means continuous integration

5- If everything is ok, it will show this page saying that your application was successfully uploaded.

6- Click Add custom domain to place a domain you have purchased or click Edit site name to change only the Netlify domain name:

And voila, your application is already online and 100% free.

Thanks for reading.]]></summary>

There are some workarounds for this problem. You can create a shareable link to a view in Airtable, but anyone who gets a hold of that link will have access to your client’s sensitive data. Alternatively, you can give clients direct access to your Airtable base. But because Airtable lacks granular access control, they’d be able to see all your other clients’ projects, too. Finally, you could use a no-code interface builder, but then you’re limited by the features their WYSIWYG editors support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to present you a simple script which I wrote when I needed to merge the passwords database from LastPass to my current KeepassXC database.

Let's start with my example, you want to migrate from LastPass but you already have existing passwords in Keepass.
That's why I wrote this script which will merge multiple databases exported in CSV and remove duplikats automatically.
ProHint: If you are esporting a database from LastPass (or other services), add the exported CSV first to the new Keepass database and set the columns you have on your other Keepass database and export as new CSV file. This will make sure you have the same columns in the current database and the new one.
My columns look like this: 
Group | Title | Username | Password | URL | Notes
To install and start the CSV database merge you can easily install from npmjs.com
$ npm install merge-csv-keepass -g
or
$ yarn global add merge-csv-keepass

It is very easy to use, after installation you have access to a new command merge-csv-keepass where you just need to add few arguments and you are done!
Example, we have a database db1.csv and db2.csv we want to merge them into a file merged_db.csv to do this we run the command:
merge-csv-keepass -source db1.csv db2.csv -output merged_db.csv

Done! Simple, isn't it?
Keep in mind that the script does not check if the output file exists! If it exists it will overwrite it!
Of course you can add more databases than just two to merge, or even just one database to only remove duplikats from it.
The whole project is open source and available on Github.

        merge-csv-keepass
      
    
Enjoy your merging! :)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a short introduction to relational database design and the Structured Query Language (SQL). Many people organize their electronic data into spreadsheets. This works great if the data is simple, small, and not likely to be tracked for very long periods of time. However, when you have more sophisticated, larger, and long-lived data sets the spreadsheet approach breaks down. In these examples I discuss why this is the case and how to build and query relational databases.
I use a relational database management system called SQLite. SQLite is one of my favorite tools. It is an open-source, full-featured relational database management system where an entire database is stored in a single file. I also use an accompanying tool called 'DB Browser for SQLite' because it provides a nice user …]]></summary>

If you look at the whole range of build tools we use every framework is enhanced by some build ahead process. And if you want to take it to its natural extent you might land on, as @swyx
 did in his article Language Servers are the new Frameworks, down to a language itself.
But there are more steps still to go on this path. This trend of UI Framework in JavaScript being a language goes back much further. Elm(2012), Marko(2014), and Imba(2015) are just handful. But fast-forward to 2021 and we have many more libraries in this space.

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
