                    <span>The first time I was to ever host a Vue app on Heroku was a hustle. I ran into multiple errors which then inspired this article to help make the life of my fellow Vue developers easier by putting together the right and easy way to host apps on Heroku.
Heroku is one of the tools used by developers to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps. Some reasons you would want to choose Heroku as your host is because it&#x27;s user friendly, supports several databases and data stores, you also have the option to link your app directly from GitHub and enable default deployment each time you push some code into master (isn&#x27;t that amazing!).
To follow along, I want to assume you have a Vue app up and running and you also have an Heroku account. That out of the way, lets get right into it.

                    <span>Using Node in the Command Line


Summary
To use Node as a REPL, simply type¬†node¬†in the Terminal.
Press the¬†Tab¬†key to get a list of Node commands.
To exit the REPL, hold down the Ctrl and c keys twice.
JavaScript scripts can be run in terminal using the¬†node¬†command. For instance,¬†node name-of-script.js.
console.log()¬†happens to use a method called¬†process.stdout.write()¬†under the hood.¬†stdout¬†is short for¬†standard output. Standard input is for data streaming into a program while standard output is for data streaming out of a program.
We can use the¬†require¬†statement to add a script&#x27;s functionality to the Node REPL. For instance:¬†require(&#x27;./code-to-be-required.js&#x27;). A relative path must be included.
Terminology

To document BobaBoard&#x27;s REST API.
Standardize (and document) both the parameters and the return values of various endpoints.
The documentation should be as close as possible to the source code it describes.
The documentation should be served through a docusaurus instance hosted on a different server.


SwaggerJSDoc: to turn JSDocs into the final OpenAPI spec (served at /open-api.json).
Redocusaurus: to embed Redoc into Docusaurus. There are other options for documentation, like any OpenAPI/Swagger compatible tool (e.g. SwaggerUI), but Redoc is the nicest feeling one.

Esse conte√∫do √© oferecido e distribu√≠do pela comunidade Kotlinautas, uma comunidade brasileira que busca oferecer conte√∫do gratuito sobre a linguagem Kotlin em um espa√ßo plural.

Ktor √© um framework para Kotlin para criar microservi√ßos, websockets, MVC&#x27;s e servi√ßos web em geral.
Ktor tem uma diferen√ßa em rela√ß√£o aos frameworks que geralmente s√£o usados com a linguagem Kotlin. Ktor √© feito inteiramente em Kotlin, diferente de outros frameworks, como Spring ou Micronaut. Essa diferen√ßa faz com que o Ktor se encaixe perfeitamente com Kotlin, enquanto que os outros frameworks que n√£o s√£o feitos inteiramente em Kotlin (Pois foram feitos inicialmente para Java) n√£o conseguem fazer.
Ktor tem um site oficial onde pode ser encontrada a sua documenta√ß√£o.

                    <span>So first of all let me tell you what actually is a JSX !



  
  
  A JSX(JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.


Here is an Example :
const element &#x3D; 
Hello, world!
;

It is pretty similar to HTML syntax. üê±‚Äçüë§

React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.
Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù that contain both. ~ React üòé
This is what was said by react developers when it was first announced, in my opinion this is a very useful syntax extension to JavaScript, it has made things very easy to configure and manage in a very large code base.


It makes it easier for us to create templates.




  
  
  The main difference between HTML and JSX ü§Ø


1)  HTML is a Hypertext Markup Language, the standard markup   language for documents designed to display and view on the web in a web browser.
2) JSX JSX (JavaScript + XML) is an extension of JavaScript that permits you to write down HTML directly within JavaScript
3) HTML elements have attributes where as JSX elements have props.
JSX allows us to use attributes with the HTML elements just like we do with normal HTML. But instead of the normal naming convention of HTML, JSX uses camelCase convention for attributes

                    <span>Like star rating, reactions is something widely used in many websites so here I am with my own implementation: A CSS-only reaction component that works with emojis or any kind of custom icons. 
No need to bother yourself dealing with SVG or PNG images. Grab you favorite emoji and build your own component.
See it in play:




In the above you will find no @keyframes. All the animations are done using only CSS transition
The above rely on the very basic HTML code:





Nothing complex. An  with its corresponding  and a  element having our Emoji as data attribute. That&#x27;s it!
All the magic is done using CSS and we have different layers illustrated like below:

                    <span>As part of this blog lets see two ways in which you can truncate a text using CSS
.truncate-ellipsis {
  width: 350px;
  white-space: nowrap;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
  display: block;
}

With text-overflow , ellipsis can be applied to single line of text, provided the following conditions are met. [ For truncating after multiple lines, keep reading  üòâ ].
the element  must have 
&gt; width , max-width or flex-basis(if using flex)
the element must have property 
&gt; word-wrap: nowrap


overflow property should have value other than visible . 
&gt; eg: overflow: hidden;
must have display value as block, inline-block or any other equivalent such as flex item etc.  display:inline will not work here.
&gt; eg: display: inline-block;

                    <span>MDX Blog
A lazily named blog that hosts markdown files ‚úçüèºüí§

I have been hearing a lot about static site generators and wanted to try them, this was a exploratory POC created for learning purposes.
mdx-blog is a lazily named blog that hosts markdown files (surprisingly!) built using Gatsby JS.
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
You have installed the latest version of node, npm




  
  
  Getting mdx-blog


To install mdx-blog, follow these steps:
git clone https://github.com/2kabhishek/mdx-blog
cd mdx-blog

Clone this to your local and run the following to run the server and play around with the code.
# From the cloned directory
npm install # Install dependencies
gatsby develop # Run the local dev server
$EDITOR . # Open in your preferred editor, TIP: Hot Reload!

mdx-blog was built using Gatsby JS v3, behind the scenes it&#x27;s also using React, Graph QL, Theme UI etc.
While building mdx-blog the main challenges were mostly conceptual, really understanding the benefits and drawbacks of static site generators.
Also faced a minor issue with MDX rendering initially.
While building mdx-blog I learned about:
Static site generators in general


When to use and when not to use
Gatsby JS: A great tool for quickly building static sites


Very extensible
Has great documentation
GraphQL (and the GraphiQL tool)


Really love the specificity and usability of this
Side tracked a bit and learned about Hasura as well
Theme UI didn&#x27;t play much with it, but really love the idea behind centralized styling.
React ;)
Want to add syntax highlighting for code blocks.
Add better MDX rendering

                    <span>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React utilizes reusable components. This allows you to reuse your code, control how the components update, and control how they communicate with each other.
Props allows us to pass data between React components. We can pass callback functions and other pieces of data. We can attach multiple props to each component. Passing props and accessing them is very simple. Lets look at some examples.
function Home(){
   return(
)
}

Above we have a functional component Home that renders a second function component Greeting. Right now this is just a simple render. There is no passing of information between the two components.
To understand how props work, we must first understand the relationship between paren‚Ä¶</span>
