          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

One of the ways that we can improve all of these factors in our code is by using interfaces.\nThis article is aimed at developers who have a basic understanding of OOP (object oriented programming) concepts and using inheritance in PHP. If you know how to use inheritance in your PHP code, this article should hopefully be understandable.\nIn basic terms, interfaces are just descriptions of what a class should do.

          "description": "During Gatsby page development, when you hit a page that doesn't exist, you encounter a screen similar to the one below.\n\nIf you created a custom 404 page, for example in src/pages/404.js, you can click the Preview custom 404 page to display it. Entering the /404 route will do the job as well.\nIn production, however, the 404 page doesn't get handled by itself unless you use a dedicated hosting service for Gatsby pages. That's because Gatsby's development server is no longer present. The production bundle is just a bunch of static files. Making use of a web server (like nginx) to serve the production page forces you to configure the error pages yourself.\nDisclaimer: the following nginx configuration is pretty basic, don't use it in production.\nLet's assume your blog is hosted on the personalblog.com domain and is served from the /var/www/blog directory on port 80.\nserver {\n        listen 80;\n        root /var/www/blog;\n        server_name personalblog.com www.personalblog.com;\n        location / {\n                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;\n        }\n}\n\nAfter entering a route that doesn't exist in your production Gatsby site, nginx displays its default 404 error page.\n\nAdding the error_page 404 /404; line makes nginx redirect to the /404 route in case of a 404 error. Your custom Gatsby 404 page will be displayed.\nserver {\n        listen 80;\n        root /var/www/blog;\n        server_name personalblog.com www.personalblog.com;\n        error_page 404 /404;\n        location / {\n                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;\n        }\n}\n\nVisit the error_page docs section to explore the rest of the configuration options.",

          "description": "Programming is not something that readily comes into mind when thinking about art, but many applications of programming allow for artistic expression. There is even a field of programming called creative coding where the goal is not to create something functional but rather expressive.\nEven though programming for art has been a thing for a while, it used to be fairly inaccessible as it required deep knowledge in the field. Take Demoscene, for example. Demoscene is a computer art subculture that has been around since the 1980s. It involves creating audiovisual presentations, called demos, that are not only artistic creations but also technical achievements.\n\n\n\n\nIt can be challenging, even for a programmer, to understand how a demo is implemented.

You may imagine even a simple e-commerce page: the user could want to see an article, then a second one, and then go back to the first. In such a case it's a sure bet that the app would redo its previous API calls, to essentially get the very same information it already had. Caching by the browser may help, for sure, but that also depends on the remote server providing the appropriate headers, and that may not always happen. So, we want to do something in our code that will complement whatever caching is done by the browser, if any, but ensure the best performance for the user in any case.\nIn the previous article in this series, we showed how we coul…",

It’s a space for you to collaborate with your colleagues and make decisions faster.\nBut have you ever felt overwhelmed by the constant stream of information Slack gives you? As your team grows, Slack becomes more crowded with streams, channels, and conversations. It becomes a never-ending source of noise, and hard to keep up with. With so many updates, messages, and files, it’s easy to get lost in the noise.\nDo you sometimes struggle with the feeling of FOMO — “fear of missing out” when it comes to your Slack messages?
