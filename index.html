toFixed(digits) returns as a string the specified number rounded to a given number of decimals.

isInteger(num): is a static method used to check if the given value is an integer.




console.log(Number.isInteger(-1)) // true
console.log(Number.isInteger(400.00)) // true
console.log(Number.isInteger(657.1540)) // false
console.log(Number.isInteger(Math.PI)) // false

isNaN(num) : is a static method used to check if the given value is not a number

All projects should have a semantic versioning, so it would facilitate the use of specific versions as dependencies and old versions for specific platforms or even avoid that bug that appeared in the X.Y.Z version of the project.
Simple set of rules and requirements that determine how version numbers are assigned and in turn incremented.
MAJOR: when you make incompatible API changes;
MINOR: when you add backward-compatible functionality;
PATCH: when you fix backward compatible bugs.
You can read more about the specification at: https://semver.org/
When you are going to update a project and want to know what has changed, you go after all the previous releases and the changelog is a file that makes this easier for you and your users.
Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There must be an entry for each version.
Changes of the same type must be grouped together.
Versions and sections must be linked (with links).
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.
Mention whether you follow semantic versioning.
Create your tags to help view the changelog, if you need help here are some patterns:
You can read more about it at: https://keepachangelog.com/
If you have any questions, complaints or tips, you can leave them here in the comments. I will be happy to answer!

It&#x27;s amazing what you can cook up by mixing together a few hooks.  I thought I&#x27;d put together an overview of how to make a powerful useAsync hook that allows you to do all sorts of cool progress animations.
Here&#x27;s a sneak peek at it updating multiple areas of a React app:




As you can see multiple parts of the interface update independently and we can restart the operation by changing a few deps - which cancels the previous operation.
For the purpose of this hook we are going to combine the useMemo, useState, and useRef hooks to produce a useAsync hook that takes an async function which gets passed some utility functions which can be used to provide intermediate results as it executes, check whether the function should cancel and restart the operation…</span>

                    <span>One of the most difficult things in software development is determining how long it will take to work on a new product and how much it will cost. Why is it so hard? The answer is not too obvious.
Estimating the cost of a new product is fundamentally difficult, and people are not very good at predicting events accurately. No project repeats another, each is unique not only in its goals, but also in the countless features that shape it. Often a problem that is simple at first glance turns out to be much more complicated from the inside, and sometimes it requires serious technical improvements to solve it. And, undoubtedly, in any project there are always many unknowns that arise already in the process of working on it.

In addition, there are no identical people - no customers, no developers, no users. We all start working with our baggage of knowledge, experience, values, expectations, willingness to take risks and adaptability.

We are constantly working on planning and adapting the project from the initial general level down to the smallest detail, if it allows you to avoid unnecessary costs and implement controlled changes.</span>

First, let us talk about the broad idea of what generators are. The way I understood it generators are a special type of function that does not return a value but instead it returns multiple values whenever you ask for them. 
Generators can be imagined as a way to stop the execution of a function at a specific point and retrieve the output and then continue the execution. What makes the execution stops is a special keyword called yield so whenever this keyword is …</span>

I have been working with C all my professional and student life. There have been times when I had to look a little deeper to understand what is going on with my buggy program. There are many tools and techniques to examine an executable and this post is about that and a little bit of reverse engineering.
As an example I wrote a pretty basic piece of code with some intentional inclusions. There are two global variables msga and msgb. Two user defined routines allow and deny that get executed inside the main function. One conditional call to an external program using execvp. The idea here is to examine the executable this program creates. Find out where the code I wrote lands in the executable and what compiler adds on top of it. Later I&#x27;ll showcase some basic reverse engineer…</span>

                    <span>Function can simply be defined as a sequence of statements that execute in a certain order.For function to work it has to be called or invoked,by simply using the function’s name with parentheses.
There are three types of functions in Python:
Built-in functions : These are functions that come preloaded in python.You only need to call them.Examples: help(),print() , min()
User-Defined Functions (UDFs):These are functions created by the user to avoid repetition of code.In this blog,We will majorly focus on this type of functions. 
Anonymous functions: which are also called lambda functions because they are not declared with the standard def keyword.
In python,UDFs are defined using a keyword &quot;def&quot;

Containerization is packaging up your product (software, web app ... etc) with all its dependencies in a self-contained package so that it can be run uniformly and consistently on any infrastructure without going through troublesome setup process example: missing dependencies... etc.

                    <span>Hashnode is a free platform for developer blogging. Say you’ve just finished an ambitious project and want to write about 10 important lessons you’ve learned as a developer during it. You should definitely blog it—I love that kind of blog post, myself. Making a jump into the technical debt of operating your own blog isn’t a small choice, but it’s important to own your own content. With Hashnode, the decision gets a lot easier. You can blog under a site you entirely own, and at the same time, reap the benefits of hosted software tailor-made for developer blogging and be part of a social center around developer writing.
