If you are a developer dealing with &#x60;JavaScript&#x60; on a daily basis then it is very likely to assume that you have at least heard about the typeof operator. As we know the syntax of the &#x60;typeof&#x60; operator is followed by it&#x27;s &#x60;operand&#x60; which is an expression representing the &#x60;object&#x60; or &#x60;primitive&#x60; whose type is to be returned.
Following that definition, &#x60;typeof(ANY_PRIMITIVE_TYPE)&#x60; should return that primitive type as a string and anything else apart from the primitive types should be treated as type &quot;object&quot;.
As of date, JavaScript has 7 primitive data types available in the language: 
 string 
 number 
 bigint 
 boolean 
 undefined 
 symbol 
 null 
 Let us run the following code in console and see what each of them returns for &#x60;Primitive&#x60; types:

                    <span>Un set es un tipo de objeto incluido en ES2015 que tiene semejanzas con un array:
  Contiene una lista de datos de cualquier tipo
  Es iterable
  Permite el uso del operador spread
Pero también diferencias:
  Sus datos no se repiten
  No cuenta con los métodos de Array (map, some, filter)
  Es un poco más performante
Un Set es un tipo de objeto, por lo que su sintaxis es la misma que la de un constructor:
const unSetVacío &#x3D; new Set();

Si queremos inicializar nuestro Set con valores, deberemos pasar como argumento un array
const redesSociales &#x3D; new Set([&quot;Facebook&quot;, &quot;Twitter&quot;, &quot;Fotolog&quot;]);

El objeto Set tiene metodos propios para agregar, borrar y comprobar datos
Para agregar datos a un Set, contamos con el método .add()
redesSociales.add(&quot;Instagram&quot;);
redesSociales.add(&quot;MySpace&quot;);

React is an extremely popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. A lot of developers prefer this library because it’s all based on components and has a lot of cool packages that we can use. In addition to that, now we have React hooks which came to save us from the complexity of class components.
React Hooks are very powerful and allow us to use state in functional components. They also give us the ability to create logic and functionality inside stateless functional components. Many developers now prefer to use hooks and functional components rather than class components because the class syntax is a little hard to write. There are a lot of useful hooks that you can use in your React code to create logic and add features t…</span>

                    <span>What is Jamstack?


If you are learning web development, you may have heard this term before. The term Jamstack was first coined by Mathias Biilmann, CEO of Netlify in 2015.
JAM stands for JavaScript, Api&#x27;s, and markup. It was a revolutionary new approach to building websites. This approach is not a framework, but is actually an architectural guideline using  many of the tools and skills that developers were already familiar with. 
Since it&#x27;s conception, it has only grown in popularity and is now an important part of a web developers toolbelt.
Jamstack has many benefits and advantages that set it apart from other techniques. 
It offers better performance, security, scalability, 
Developers can build faster with less complications, and can focus more on user experience. Businesses can then be more agile in competitive markets, and make their customers more satisfied. End users get better content that is delivered faster.
Its a win-win for end users, developers, and businesses.
Jamstack offers better performance by pre-rendering pages and content on build, as opposed to each time a user visits a webpage.
Pre-rendering is typically done as static pages at build time 
Once an image, video, or other content is loaded for the first 
Security is stronger because it has less points, or vectors, of potential weakness. It lives on fewer servers and databases which are frequently targeted.
It is more scalable because the webpage&#x27;s content can be cached in a content delivery network. Unexpected heavy traffic can be handled much easier and this means less down time.
Maintaining the systems is also easier through the use of a CDN. There is less complexity and therefore, fewer areas that can fail. 
Most aspects have to work at build time, so by the time a webpage is live, it has already been tested.
Now that you have been introduced to what Jamstack is and how it works, its time to take the next step. The best way to learn is to build!

If you&#x27;ve enjoyed this blog post, maybe consider checking out my Twitter and GitHub 😁 and I&#x27;d also really appreciate if you all could check out my portfolio site 🙏🏼
We started the week off by getting together in our newly assigned teams, to have a play around with version control in a team as opposed to in the usual pairing set-up. This was good to have a small play around with before we got stuck into the project, so we can hopefully minimise the issues once we start on our more valuable code!

                    <span>So in this blog post I will be talking about some of the few inbuilt functions in CPP in string (C++)



  
  
  The function in C++ language is also known as procedure or subroutine in other programming languages.



  
  
  To perform any task, we can create function. A function can be called many times. It provides modularity and code reusability.


As we all know C++ is a language that has a rich and vast library, some of which are :-
1) Length Function:



  
  
  Here with the use of this function we can find out the length of a particular array !!



Syntax: strlen(str);


Here in the following image the strlen is the main function that we are using to find out the length of the particular string.
2) Compare Function:

                    <span>Variables


We use variables to temporarily store data in the computer’s memory.
price &#x3D; 10
rating &#x3D; 4.9
course_name &#x3D; ‘Python for Beginners’
is_published &#x3D; True
In the above example,
• price is an integer (a whole number without a decimal point)
• rating is a float (a number with a decimal point)
• course_name is a string (a sequence of characters)
• is_published is a boolean. Boolean values can be True or False.
We use comments to add notes to our code. Good comments explain the hows and
whys, not what the code does. That should be reflected in the code itself. Use
comments to add reminders to yourself or other developers, or also explain your
assumptions and the reasons you’ve written code in a certain way.
We can receive input from the user by calling the input() function.

Framer motion improves upon and simplifies the API in a way that couldn&#x27;t have been done without breaking changes and rewriting. As a react developer, I found it very exciting as I can create animations using technologies that I’m already familiar with.
What is Framer Motion?
Framer Motion is a production-ready motion library to create animations using React. It brings declarative animations, effortless layout transitions, and gestures while maintaining HTML and SVG semantics.
How to use Framer Motion in our Project
Install framer motion using in your project using
npm install framer-motion 

Remember one thing Framer-Motion requires that you are using React version 16.8 or higher.

                    <span>When you&#x27;re a software professional, 1 thing you must&#x27;ve dreaded is setting up a new Windows machine (as in a development environment). This might be since doing so needs either downloading multiple .MSI / .EXE files of the required applications or using the Microsoft App Store (personally I believe it&#x27;s a little off the mark compared to the Linux/MacOS).  
It&#x27;s also compounded by the fact Windows systems are regarded relatively volatile so we never re-touch/re-configure applications once installed. You also must&#x27;ve surely wondered why Windows trails Linux/Mac OS when it comes to Command Line. Agreed, PowerShell changes most of that but learning a new syntax can be a little harrowing.
What if I told you this could be solved permanently via CLI? Enter Chocolatey to the rescue.

Say you’ve just finished an ambitious project and want to write about 10 important lessons you’ve learned as a developer during it. You should definitely blog it—I love that kind of blog post, myself. Making a jump into the technical debt of operating your own blog isn’t a small choice, but it’s important to own your own content. With Hashnode, the decision gets a lot easier. You can blog under a site you entirely own, and at the same time, reap the benefits of hosted software tailor-made for developer blogging and be part of a social center around developer writing.
