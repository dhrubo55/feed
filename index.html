                    <span>Modules


The module pattern has essentially the same goal as the class pattern, which is to group data and behavior together into logical units. 
ES6 added a module syntax form to native JS syntax, which we’ll look at in a moment. But from the early days of JS, modules was an important and common pattern that was leveraged in countless JS programs, even without a dedicated syntax.
Because a module of this form is just a function, and calling it produces an “instance” of the module, another description for these functions is “module factories”.
BlogPost classes:
function Publication(title, author, pubDate) {
    var publicAPI &#x3D; {
        print() {
            console.log(&#x60;
 Title: ${ title }
 By: ${ author }
 ${ pubDate }
 &#x60;);
        }
    };

                    <span>This is the story of a bug that I found while developing my blog. It got me puzzled for a while until I found a seemingly unrelated issue that caused the problem. It may be a bit silly, but it could also be interesting because it showcases a difference in how social networks processed the page’s metadata.
When sharing a link from my blog on social media, the thumbnail picture looked Ok on Twitter or Linkedin, but it was different on Facebook. The Twitter card had the blog post thumbnail, but the Facebook card showed the generic website thumbnail:

 



I was filling both the OpenGraph and the Twitter card metadata with the same information. So it should be the same image.
I started digging in the code and found that this was the meta-information for the blog posts (code reduced):

GET: is a request used for getting or retrieving data or information from a specified server.
const getTodo &#x3D; (id) &#x3D;&gt; {

        .catch((e) &#x3D;&gt; console.log(&#x27;something went wrong ;(&#x27;, e));
};
getTodo(1);

const getTodo &#x3D; async (id) &#x3D;&gt; {
    const url &#x3D; &#x60;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/${id}&#x60;;
    try {
        const response &#x3D; await fetch(url);
        const data &#x3D; await response.json();
        console.log(data);
    } catch (e) {
        console.log(&#x27;something went wrong :(&#x27;, e);
    }
};
getTodo(1);

const getTodo &#x3D; async (id) &#x3D;&gt; {

                    <span>I love typescript, it makes my life super easy and makes my dev experience far superior. That said one gripe I&#x27;ve always had in complex typescript codebase is with nested types, especially using things like Pick or Omit you had to check the type definition, 4-5 levels deep to actually know what the type is, this can be quite annoying.
Recently I found a solution a great solution to this called Type Widening and it can be super easily implemented.
If you just want the basic type, here you go.  That said I will break down how this works and how you can improve it below. You can also find a more advanced version of this with recursion and enum guards at bottom of the post.

Today, I will be talking through the Virtual DOM through the structure of the questions to follow:
What is the DOM?
What is the Virtual DOM?
Why do we use the Virtual DOM? How does the Virtual DOM apply to ReactJS?
☁️ Let&#x27;s get started ☁️
We should probably start at the beginning. 
(1)The DOM, short for &quot;Document Object Model&quot;, is a data representation of the structure and content of a document in the browser. 
As it represents a browser&#x27;s document and is comprised of objects, it can be manipulated using scripting languages, such as JavaScript. 
An example of a DOM may look like this:

                    <span>In this article, I&#x27;m going to show techniques and tips for transforming raw text data to standard format using VSCode. It&#x27;s effective, quick, and dirty. Suitable for one-time wrangling.

People who works around data sometimes get strange one-time requests. 
&quot;Hey, can you get this data real quick? Shouldn&#x27;t be too hard, right? Appreciate it&quot;. 
It happended to me (as full-stack dev) few times, say: list of banks, list of loan rates, and so on. It&#x27;s good thing that the data is available. It&#x27;s bad thing that they are in PDF or HTML table. My system only works with CSV or JSON. So it is wrangling time!
There are many tools available for wrangling data. Nearly all of them are sophisticated and packed with features. Too many features means too many resource needed. I don&#x27;t want to open Jupyter No…</span>

                    <span>What bothers me about JS is the way packages and tools are named.
This post is inspired by this post.
I don&#x27;t like the naming with an extension.
Like &quot;Node.js&quot;.
It is not the name of a file.
Similally, react.js, vue.js, next.js... are not the names of files. Well maybe sometimes, as a compiled result, but not in the source code and it usually it is vue-1.2.3-esm.js or whatever as a long name anyway.
So why add extension? And not use it consistently?
You don&#x27;t have to tell people the name of your language in your runtime or package name. Who doesn&#x27;t know what Node or React are in JS or might confuse them with something else of JS if &quot;.js&quot; was omitted?
We don&#x27;t call it &quot;pandas.py&quot;, &quot;requests.py&quot;, &quot;grails.jar&quot; or &quot;rails.rb&quot; (say that out loud!) in other languages. Yes, Python packages have Py names sometimes like Pygame or Numpy, but that is fun and artistic and doesn&#x27;t go to extension level convention.
And Node and Node.js and NodeJS are all (sort of) correct spellings. Things diverge in the JS community, rather than converge (e.g. JavaScript, ECMAScript and EMScript are all the same thing and ES6 and ES2015 are the same thing).
And some say &quot;Node dot JS&quot; aloud,  which is annoying. It sounded so verbose on NextConf for the presenters to say Next dot JS all the time when it is clear from the context and &quot;Next&quot; would be fine.
Typing &quot;next.js&quot; is the most common way for packages while &quot;DocsifyJS&quot; is the preferred way of some packages like in Docsify docs.
Anyway, that has been bothering me a while and wanted to vent about inconsistencies in the language we love to hate but can&#x27;t do without (yet).</span>

A brief introduction to the new-ish Google Sign In api
How to implement it using React and Typescript


Add relevant typings on global window object
Google recently announced they are discontinuing their old auth-service &quot;Google Sign-In&quot; in favor for their new and improved service &quot;Sign In With Google&quot;.
Their new service comes in two parts:
Login button
One Tap
You can read more about them here. 
Compared to the old service, this one is much easier to use. It&#x27;s straight-forward enough to implement the login button yourself without needing a library like (the awesome) react-google-login that&#x27;s the go-to solution for the old api. 
I&#x27;m just going to go over the basics here.

No Twitter e nos grupos do Telegram que eu participo vejo com muita frequência dúvidas sobre como e onde usar certas unidades CSS ou pessoas utilizando e manipulando unidades de forma incorreta. Para deixar claro, o que considero como uso incorreto de unidades CSS é utilizá-las de maneira que prejudique a acessibilidade e realizar operações com elas que o browser não consegue computar ou que são baseadas em números mágicos ou lógicas obscuras.

Without a secure system, your valuable information can be compromised in a malicious cyber attack. Both small and large businesses can be the victim to data theft and cybercriminals.
