          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

That's poor programming practice and what would you do if it was a company's database?\nLaravel migrations simply allows you to easily perform certain actions to the database without going to the database manager (eg. phpMyAdmin). They can also serve as a version control for your database. \nA default laravel migration file comes with a class definition containing both an up() and a down() method.

This is in contrast to RESTful APIs, that might result in a chain or waterfall of requests, with each request requiring data from the previous, in order to retrieve all of the data from the API server.\nTypically a GraphQL client is used to facilitate the client side query building, and to send HTTP POST requests containing GraphQL queries to the GraphQL server responsible for returning the data.
