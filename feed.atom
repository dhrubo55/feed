This, however, is not the case.
State updates using this.setState or useState do not immediately mutate the state but create a pending state transition. Accessing state immediately after calling the updater method can potentially return the old value.
There is no guarantee of synchronous operation of state update calls and multiple state updates can be batched for performance reasons.
State updates alter the virtual DOM and cause re-rendering which may be an expensive operation. Making state updates synchronous could make the browser unresponsive due to huge number of updates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, Hi there! This is my first Dev.to post, and I'm really excited to begin here! 😁
Perhaps, you already know me from my Tumblr, or my Medium. But nice, and original content will be written here, so take a seat!
To start off, I decided to share a little piece of mathematical knowledge, that, although simple, it is very common to forget, or simply don't come across. But is very useful, and, if you want to follow the path of machine learning, for instance, it is a must know basic concept.
So let's jump in!
O.b.s: I'm assuming you already know the base concepts of statistics. Such as average, mode and median.
You can think variance, just like the average means like the "center" of the data, variance can mean how the data actually behaves around that "center".
For instance, let's take the mean of these table, which show how many hours of sleep Greg had last week:



Week day
Hours Slept




Monday
7 hours


Tuesday
8 hours


Wednesday
6 hours


Thursday
0 hours


Friday
7 hours


Saturday
7 hours


Sunday
10 hours



This data gives as a average of: 7,6 hours slept per night.
But, let's change the question here, and if we want to know ˜how constant˜ is the sleeping behavior of Greg?
So, now we want to know, having an average behavior of 7,6 hour slept/night, how constant was these hours?
Variance is defined by:
Σ(average - x)² / n 

-> x being the hours slept.
-> n being the amount of data.

So, the example above would evaluate to:
(7-6.42)² + (8-6.42)² + (6-6.42)² + (0-6.42)² + (7-6.42)² + (7-6.42)² + (10-6.42)²

which would result: 10.38
Now that you understood variance, the standard deviation, is used to minimize the noise made by the ²'s on variance's formula.
Calculate de SD by: sqrt(variance)
In our case, it will be: 3.22
If you're a little advanced in Maths, you can think of variance as the value of a function y, and the SD being the derivative of the same function. 😉
Both have lots of use-cases, that I pretend to bring here on future posts. Hope it helps! 😁]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you encountered a challenge where you need to fetch records from the database in no particular order using Laravel?
I found myself at this point once and here is how I solved it. All thanks to dear Google!😍
This is a regular SQL query to fetch records randomly:
select * from `users` order by RAND() ```



But in Laravel, there is a method named

 ```inRandomOrder()```

 which simply fetches the records in random order.

Here is a list of the few ways this method can be used:




```PHP

//Fetch all records in random order
Model::inRandomOrder()->get();

// 5 indicates the number of records
Model::inRandomOrder()->limit(5)->get();

//Fetc all records in pages or sets of 6
Model::inRandomOrder()->paginate(6)->get();

// get one random record
Model::inRandomOrder()->first()

The helper method can also be used like this:
Model::where('name',$name)->inRandomOrder()->get();

PS: The inRandomOrder() method can also be used alongside other helper methods for fetching records like paginate() and limit().
I trust this will be of great assistance🥰. I would also love to learn more about this so please feel free to drop your comments or send a direct message on  twitter.
Thank you😎]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a back-end engineer, dealing with forms is almost inevitable. I'll be doing a short guide on how to use Form Requests to validate data requests in Laravel 
The prominent way of validating data requests in Laravel is by  using the validate method or validator facade in our controller like this:


Now there is absolutely nothing wrong with this method but think about scenarios where you need to perform a validation logic more than once, this is one advantage of Form Requests.
So, what are Form Requests?
One more benefit😍 is that you can also customize your validation error messages. Amazing right?😉 
I'll be creating a basic User Registration API with Form Requests Validation, so follow through carefully.👌

Bash Scripting is a powerful skill to have as a programmer because we find Linux almost everywhere and to get through it you must have a command over its interface which is generally the BASH shell. Vim is a great option for doing this, or probably the best out there! Because Vim is pre-installed in almost every Linux distribution. This is not an in-depth setup for BASH on Vim, it is a simple editorial on starting up BASH scripting on the Vim editor. So without wasting time on "Vim features" let's dive in with the setup for BASH in Vim.
Setting up a bash script doesn't require much code but still in some cases it can be a bit hassle and to avoid the repetitive task, one can easily set up a macro for the boilerplate BASH script.

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<replace_with_channel_id>
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
