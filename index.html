                    <span>I don&#x27;t use React often and so whenever I need to do even the smallest thing in React, I have to check out the documentation, a tutorial, or post a question on a forum.
That&#x27;s why I decided to do this memory aid and given that my memory is not that good I thought why not make a monstrous memory aid with all the concepts I know about React.
So I can read it from time to time and thereby strengthen my knowledge of React.

                    <span>As awesome as flexbox is, what it’s doing under the hood is actually a little strange because, by default, it is doing two things at once. It first looks at the content size which is what we would get if by declaring width: max-content on an element. But on top of that, flex-shrink is also doing some work allowing the items to be smaller, but only if needed.
Let’s break those two down and see how they work together.

The GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) is a redesigned, enhanced version of GitHub Packages. It not only replaces the Packages Docker service, but also it represents a fundamental shift in how GitHub will provide packages to its customers, because Packages are now tied to organizations and accounts instead of repos.

                    <span>As you could probably tell from the title, we shipped an SDK for Next.js. This means you can capture errors, measure performance, manage releases, configure suspect commits, and automatically upload sourcemaps to view unminified JavaScript and TypeScript with zero(-ish) configuration.
Why was Next.js next on our list? Well, it’s one of the fastest-growing React frameworks and developers love it. Next.js provides a developer experience that helps with building features rapidly, seeing local changes quickly, and reducing build times.
&quot;Next.js turns traditionally complex decisions into simple implementation details. Spinning up new pages with our existing React components and Material UI went from days to hours with Next.&quot;

Let’s take a look at how that would work in a world without CORS:
A user just visited &quot;https://mybank.example&quot;, one of the most popular
banking websites, to complete a few transactions.
The user, maybe on another tab, visits &quot;http://not-suspicious.example&quot;.
Unknown to the user, not-suspicious.example contains a script that
sends requests to a list of endpoints from very popular banking sites. This
is all done in the background.
If a response comes back containing user session data or other sensitive
user data, the malicious site now has the means to impersonate the user.

With a live demo (he&#x27;s mad). That worked! (he&#x27;s lucky good 😁) 
And the overall was very nice to listen (he&#x27;s maybe experimented at this exercise - EDIT: yes he is).

I enjoyed the topic (ElasticSearch), the comparisons and expertise about this technology and other related ones.
And... Yes... A working live demo... What else?
OpenFoodFacts well deserved his lightning talk.

                    <span>There&#x27;s a principle in programming called Don&#x27;t Repeat Yourself (DRY). The reason repeated code is a problem is because any change requires fixing code in multiple places. This usually means more work for programmers and more room for errors.


Notice in the example below that the eat method is shared by Cat and Bear:




function Cat(name) {
  this.name &#x3D; name;
}

Cat.prototype &#x3D; {
  constructor: Cat,
  eat: function() {
    console.log(&quot;nom nom nom&quot;);
  }
};

function Bear(name) {
  this.name &#x3D; name;
}

Bear.prototype &#x3D; {
  constructor: Bear,
  eat: function() {
    console.log(&quot;nom nom nom&quot;);
  }
};

The eat method is repeated in two places. The code can be edited to follow the DRY principle by creating a supertype (or parent) called Animal:




function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype &#x3D;…</span>

                    <span>Just like people inherit genes from their parents, an object inherits its prototype directly from the constructor function that created it. For example, here the Dog constructor creates the beagle object:




function Dog(name) {
  this.name &#x3D; name;
}

let beagle &#x3D; new Dog(&quot;Snoopy&quot;);

beagle inherits its prototype from the Dog constructor function. You can show this relationship with the isPrototypeOf method:




Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle);

This would return true.
All objects in JavaScript (with a few exceptions) have a prototype. Also, an object’s prototype itself is an object.




function Dog(name) {
  this.name &#x3D; name;
}

typeof Dog.prototype; // yields object

Because a prototype is an object, a prototype can have its own prototype! In this case, the prototype of Bird.prototype is Object.prototype:


How is this useful? You may recall the hasOwnProperty method from a previous post:




let beagle &#x3D; new Dog(&quot;Snoopy&quot;);
beagle.hasOwnProperty(&quot;name&quot;);

The hasOwnProperty method is defined in Object.prototype, which can be accessed by Dog.prototype, which can then be accessed by beagle. This is an example of the prototype chain. In this prototype chain, Dog is the supertype for beagle, while beagle is the subtype. Object is a supertype for both Dog and beagle. Object is a supertype for all objects in JavaScript. Therefore, any object can use the hasOwnProperty method.</span>

What&#x27;s the first thing you do when you are looking for something?
If you&#x27;re like me, you probably pull out your phone and search for it on Google. It makes optimizing websites for search engines more important than ever. And as a developer, I get it, SEO is a critical part of any business’ online presence. It&#x27;s my job to be sure our tools can support that effort of being easily visible on search engine results pages. 
And since React is the most popular JavaScript framework, these tools will most likely be related to it or React frameworks like Next.js.
But, how can we be sure our React dynamic applications are SEO-friendly for our favorites robot crawlers to understand?

The term &quot;object&quot; denotes two kinds of objects: the key-value data structure in JavaScript, and the popular but opinionated programming methodology: OOP . This article is about the latter type of object.
In JavaScript, [almost] everything is an object. To understand the language in-depth, you first have to know what objects are and how they work.
An object is used to store key-value data. It allows for various data and complex entities to be stored. Entities within an object are known as properties. A property is a &quot;key-value&quot; pair, where the key is the property name and value can be anything
To create an object, the curly braces {...} is used with a list of optional properties. It&#x27;s possible to initialize an empty object.
// Empty object using &quot;object literal&quot; syntax
let user &#x3D; {};

                    <span>Here there are some cool tricks you can do to improve your Github Actions.
How many times you have re-installed all of your packages in your actions even when no packages were changed?
Github actions are charged based on the time they actually run;
have a look here in case you are interested 😉
To cache our modules we will use the actions/cache@v2 action
Here is an example of caching npm dependencies for Linux/MacOS
- name: Cache node_modules 📦
  uses: actions/cache@v2
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles(&#x27;**/package-lock.json&#x27;) }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-node-

Here you can see it in a Github Action used for deploying my svelte-kit powered blog to gh-pages 🚀

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
