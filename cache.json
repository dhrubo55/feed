For the endpoint, we're going to have an async Task Get method that will write the result to the Response and send it for every item it was processed.\n// StreamController.cs\nprivate readonly IService _service;\n\npublic StreamController(IService service)\n{\n    _service = service;\n}\n\n[HttpGet(\"{amount:int:min(1)}\")]\npublic async Task GetStreamData(int amount)\n{\n    // Set Content-Type to text/event-stream\n    Response.Headers.Add(\"Content-Type\", \"text/event-stream\");\n\n    await foreach(var data in _service.GetData(amount))\n    {\n        // this can be anything, even just a json object\n        string dataItem = $\"data: {data}\\n\\n\";\n\n        // Convert the text to a byte array\n        var utf8DataitemBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(dataItem);\n\n        // Write the byte array to the HttpResponse\n        await Response.Body.WriteAsync(utf8DataitemBytes, 0, utf8DataitemBytes.Length);\n        // Push\n        await Response.Body.FlushAsync();\n    }\n}\n\nWhen the endpoint is called, it'll send a new \"line\" of data instead of waiting for all items to be processed to be sent at once.",

It uses Redis to cache aggregated data for top categories and users while the database stores the item/line data as “source of truth”.\nThis article starts with a simple first use-case and then advances to a more complex one with Lua scripting and the inbox pattern.\nSetup Redis in Docker and Prepare the .NET Core Project\n\n\nImplement …",

With this wonderful tool, you can create a server with NodeJS, create routes (endpoints), handle requests to each endpoint, and lots more.\nFastify is an alternative of Express (L express) which you must have heard of if you are familiar with NodeJS before. In fact, Fastify draws its inspiration from Express only that Fastify servers are way faster compared to Express servers.\nI have tested it, and I can testify of its speed. I am currently building a Mobile Application, and in this app, I use Fastify for my API.\nSo in this article, we will be building a basic NodeJS server with Fastify. This server will have endpoints to Create data, Read dat…",

          "description": "The internet is made up of over 1.7 Billion web pages with different page layouts. Technology  nowadays is responsive to any screen orientation or dimension of the screen in our devices. Making page layout comes in handy with the use of Cascading Style Sheet also refers to as CSS. CSS is one of the cornerstones of the web. More like the flesh covering the bones of the body. It is easy to understand and there are lots of resources available on how to use this amazing piece of technology.\nSo how is this related to our topic? \nCSS is use to design layout and the appearance of those web pages but creating multi-layouts is a huddle for beginners who intend to create project with that feature. \n\nCSS Grid: This is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. Like tables, grid layout allow us to align elements into columns and rows.\ndisplay:grid, set the column and row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, and then place its child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row.\n\n\nFlexbox: The CSS Flexbox offers a one-dimensional layout. It is helpful in allocating and aligning the space among items in a container (made of grids). It works with all kinds of display devices and screen sizes.\ndisplay: flex;\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the line of divide between these two? \na. CSS Grid Layout is of two-dimensional , that means it can handle columns and rows, not like flexbox that is basically a one-dimensional.\nb. A core distinction between CSS Grid and Flexbox is their approach — CSS Grid’s \napproach is layout-first whereas Flexbox’ approach is content-first.\nc. The Flexbox layout is best suited to application components and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is designed for larger-scale layouts that are not linear in design.\nd. CSS Grid deploys fractional measure units for grid fluidity and auto-keyword functionality to automatically adjust columns or rows.",
