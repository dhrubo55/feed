Anyone interested in 3D, with no knowledge of JavaScript, this still is for you!:)\nWhen its 3D, Maya, Autodesk,and more recently Blender, Unity, Unreal come to our minds. Doing 3D stuffs with JavaScript becomes a point of notice, to only those who come across it, and I did! \nBelow are few platforms which use JavaScript to make 3D object or games or even use for rendering. \nThey can definitely be of help by integrating in your app or website, or even having fun exploring!\nThree\nThree (https://threejs.org/ )\nThree.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. You can find some cool games and websites on their official site.\n2.Babylon\nBabylon (https://www.babylonjs.com/ ) \n\nBabylon.js is a real time 3D engine for displaying 3D graphics in a web browser via HTML5.Babylon brings in the difference by using HTML5 instead of WebGL.\n3.Zdog\nZdog( https://zzz.dog/ ) \n\nReally cool Round, flat, designer-friendly pseudo-3D engine for canvas & SVG. The tutorial is even friendly and entertaining!\n4.Phoria\nPhoria (http://www.kevs3d.co.uk/dev/phoria/)\n\nAnother great site to find simple 3D graphics on a canvas 2D renderer with some wonderful examples. It is been developed by Kevin Roast and you can find the GitHub repo too.\n5.Xeogl\nXeogl ( https://xeogl.org/ )\nDeveloped by Xeolabs, it focuses on 3D visualization in the browser without using plugins! Also does it have various examples to explore!\nThat's it folks.
