Map: is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, Its keys can be any datatype(primitive, objects, functions). Additionally, The original order of elements is preserved.
Flexible with keys, because they can be any type unlike Object (keys have to be strings and symbols)


Supports millions of items, 50% more than Object. A map can store 16.7 million key-value pairs where an Object can store 11.1.

There are no default keys. Unlike objects that have default keys like valueOf

During some recently conversations with customers, one of the topics that they were interested in was how to create re-usable, parameterised Apache Airflow workflows (DAGs) that could be executed dynamically through the use variables and/or parameters (either submitted via the UI or the command line). This makes a lot of sense, as you may find that you repeat similar tasks in your workflows, and so this approach allows you to maximise the re-use of that work.
Looking at some of the threads in the Apache Airflow slack channel, as well as some of the internal channels we use, it became clear that some guidance on how to do this when using Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) would help those, either new to MWAA or coming to MWAA from self man…]]></summary>

That makes me think... What would have happened if Ada Lovelace hadn't shared her love of mathematics, even if the world wasn't so fair to her?
What would have happened if Katherine Johnson had not dared to share her knowledge and her passion for numbers? In such a hostile environment!
What would have happened if … Such a question!
So let's start sharing with love what we are and what we have to give to the world. 
If there's one thing I consider myself terrible at, it's presentations. But here I go: I'm Anto, I'm 26 years old and I love to explore, innovate and create new things. I’m a computer engineer from Santa Fe, Argentina.
I am currently working as a developer (and in constant training). I love animals. I love reading. I am a fan of TV series. I fight for a more diverse and inclusive world. In a world of ones and zeros, we have to go for diversity.. 
I'm here to improve my skills, to broaden my knowledge about software development and to improve my English, of course (actually, I started blogging to improve my English. So, sorry for the mistakes). Also, to sharing my knowledge and learning with you.
And what about you? 😊

It is important that you don't wander around in your thoughts. Decide on a pivotal idea and construct your piece around it. If you get lost, the reader will too.
Stick to your guns.
Don't worry about running out of content. Set the theme for the reader at the beginning of your article - plant a seed in their mind. Then, approach your idea through different examples, different pathways. Keep circling back to it - grow the seed you planted.
Writing is about freeing your thoughts. When going through your article, a reader should get a feeling of the author's thought…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using Typescript for development for frontend and backend development keep growing. Typescript allows for better IDE hints and less runtime errors due to type errors with its typing system. On top of that Typescript makes popular OOP patterns like dependency injection more applicable vs when typing doesn't exist like in plain javascript. (In DI, you use typing in class constructor to instantiate and inject services throughout your application)
Two frameworks keep typescript close to their hearts when building a backend application in NodeJS, NestJS and FoalTS. In this tutorial we will discuss CRUD and REST API conventions and apply them to building a basic API in Nest and FOAL.
