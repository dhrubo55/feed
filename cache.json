AKA also allows for sub-routes of shortened URLS. So typing in aka/foo/bar in your browser will redirect you to https://long-domain.com/foo/bar.\nAKA provides the same bookmarking that, for example, your bookmarks bar on your browser already provides. However, interacting with your keyboard is faster than interacting with your mouse and GUI. AKA provides short keyboard access to bookmark your most visited websites.\nAKA also gives instant access to sub-routes of websites. I've found that when I click on a website on my bookmarks bar, say https://github.com/, I usually have to navigate to some other page that I don't commonly go to, like https://github.com/settings/. Instead of interacting with the GUI on the website to find the settings page, I can have aka/gh point to https://github.com/, and visit aka/gh/settings!\nFor more information, visit https://github.com/brandonLi8/aka",

I also don't see a valid use-case to disable JavaScript in the browser.\nI am also a single person and I don't have the money to pay you any computation effort to render a page (SSR). Your browser can do that and it costs you nothing, compared to me. So I push this task to you in such small pieces that it feels all lightning fast (dynamic imports). Lighthouse is my witness. It also wouldn't work this way if JavaScript is disabled.\nSearch engines can't find my app's deeper content. That's okay, it's only for members anyway.

FastAPI enables the developers to use REST API interface and use many functions to implement them into applications, developers uses FastAPI to create login/Signup, authenticate and create accounts etc.\nFastAPI has a great future guys, companies uses this because it's very fast and highly securable and it has many feature like security and authentication, Dependency Injection, Unlimited plugins and etc, many big giants tech companies already using this framework for their data science applications and web applications, there are many companies like Microsoft and Netflix, Uber etc. Even my company use this framework, It's only 3 years old framework and it's already in trend, maybe this framework create thousands of jobs in future.\nhttps://fastapi.tiangolo.com/\n1) Bitfumes \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t2alSnE2-I\n2) IsaiahT Tech\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKL6wEqbyNs&list=PLShTCj6cbon9gK9AbDSxZbas1F6b6C_Mx\n3) Very Academy\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH4VZaP3_9s&t=242s\nfor more visit:- https://webdevcodes.com/python/what-is-fastapi-why-its-so-demanding/\n\nFind me on Linkedin\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/shivamrohillaa/\n\nThank You\nShivam Rohilla | Python Developer",

          "description": "It seems like everyone is online these days. The Internet not only facilitates interpersonal communication between users (e.g., email, social media); it’s also a much relied-upon source for all kinds of information. And a convenient means of paying bills and making purchases.\nEvery single online application has that part with which users interact. When you log onto a website, you are greeted by the welcome page, the menu, site map, and other items that facilitate navigation and utility. All of those items fall under the collective term of “front end.” The front end includes the user interface, which is the part of the website or app designed for the consumer’s use.\nWe will cover the following topics in detail that will help you get a broader understanding of what exactly front end developm…",

          "description": "As you know laravel is a popular framework based on the PHP language. It is a Model, View, Controller (MVC) structure and has many in-built features. So today we will learn the unique validation feature in laravel and how you can implement it in laravel 6, laravel 7, and laravel 8.\nThere are two ways to add unique validation on email, username, or any other fields. First, we will with the database migration and second with form request.\nTo add the unique validation in laravel migration, you have to tell the laravel that field will be unique. And you can do this by the unique() method. See the migration schema.\nSchema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {\n    $table->increments('id');\n    $table->string('name');\n    $table->string('username')->unique();\n    $table->string('email')->unique();\n    $table->string('password');\n    $table->rememberToken();\n    $table->timestamps();\n});\n\nwe applied a unique validation rule with the unique() method and made a username and email unique.\nNow what if you want to handle and present the error more user-friendly then you can use the form request validation.\nLet’s start with create a form request.\n$ php artisan make:request StoreUserRequest\n\nNow, inject the request class into the controller that you just created.\nnamespace App\\Http\\Controllers;\n\nuse App\\Http\\Requests\\StoreUserRequest;\nuse App\\User;\n\nclass UserController extends Controller\n{\n    public function store(StoreUserRequest $request) {\n        // your code here\n    }\n    public function update(UpdateUserRequest $request, User $user) {\n        // your code here\n    }\n}\n\nNow make a validation rule function in the StoreUserRequest class.\npublic function rules()\n{\n    return [\n        'name' => 'required',\n        'username' => 'required',\n        'email' => 'required|email|unique:users'\n    ];\n}\n\nYou can also make validation rule for Update case, and Rule class.\nFeel free to follow me on GitHub, LinkedIn and DEV for more!",
