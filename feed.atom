close(): helps you to close an opened file.




test_file = open('test.txt', 'r')
first_line = test_file.readline()
# do something...

test_file.close()

There is another method to close a file, that works automaticly without using close method:
with open('test.txt', 'r') as test_file:
    first_line = test_file.readline()
    # do something


readable(): checks if a specified file is readable.




with open('test.txt', 'w') as test_file:
    print(test_file.readable()) # False
    print(test_file.readline()) # error

with open('test.txt', 'r') as test_file:
    print(test_file.readable()) # True

read(size= -1): returns the given number of bytes (by default -1)  from a specified file.

Some people don’t like the term Software Engineer because of the engineering metaphor. This article is not about that term. If you don’t like it you can substitute it with Software Author, Software Craftsperson, or Software Artist!
By Software Engineer, I mean a person who looks at writing quality software as their profession. A person who applies science and statistics to that profession and does not look at it as just a job that earns money.
Knowing how to program does not make you a software engineer.
Anyone can learn to program. It’s easy. Anyone can create simple programs that work for them on their machines but that would not guarantee that the same programs will work for others.

If you missed the fun live, don't worry- you can watch the replay here on YouTube, and in the embedded video below!




On this episode we cover:
7:36 Ornella and Chloe recap what we do on Beep Boop and the ~vibes~ we want to cultivate on the show! 🤖💕


11:24 Previously on Beep Boop... we catch folks up on what we did last time, and revisit how to set up your local environment for data science coding and download VS Code so we can pick up where we left off! ☁️🏀


16:56 Frank pops in to tell us what he thinks about AI and ML 🐶🦴


18:21 We discover data that represents more than one population and talk about why that might be useful for other scenarios 🕵️‍♀️👥


34:49 We manipulate the data so we can easily distinguish between Tune Squad players 🐰🐥 and real NBA players ⛹️‍♂️


39:38 Magically impute (add in) data to our DataFrame, and get closer to a PERfect set of data 🤓


47:27 Using Machine Learning techniques like linear regression and cross-validation to finally complete our dataset - no more NaNs! 😎



Did you have fun? Check out Beep Boop 3: Create a Web App with Data and ML where we take our data on an adventure - see ya then, friends!]]></summary>

So I decided to mess around with GPT-3 the other day. I typed in APIs are, and here's an excerpt of what I got back:
The lack of standards makes it difficult to provide users with consistent experiences.
sighs Even artificial intelligence gets it. APIs are tough to use because they're not consistent. 
The first APIs used XML as a data transmission system, which gave it some semblance of structure. Later on we came up with REST, and that worked for a while, but it got a bit out of hand. 
There are some logical issues with REST. For example, think about Stripe's API (one of my favorites). They expose the ability to retrieve both one customer as well as a list of customers. How should Stripe handle this? Should the API expose two end…]]></summary>

Modern technologies like React, Vue, LESS, SASS, styled-components, etc. allow you to write more modular, reusable code. Fortunately these technologies all compile down to vanilla HTML and CSS.
So, while the endpoint accepts only vanilla HTML and CSS, you can use any technologies you'd like to generate the HTML and CSS then send it to the API. For example, you can use the aforementioned libraries like React and Vue, or even your crazy homegrown template language. As long as a library can generate HTML and CSS strings, you can use it with the API!

This series of articles will equip you with the knowledge to create, develop and deploy a Vue project with Docker. With some tweaks, you can also use the featured Dockerfiles to deploy any project, using other frameworks such as React or Svelte.
Docker is a tool to build and deploy containerized units of software. So next to the source code for the application, a Docker project will also bring the environment to run it.

The algorithm starts out by assuming all numbers are prime, and marking them as such.
The number 1 is a special case, so we start off by unmarking it.
Then we go through the numbers one by one.
If a number is still marked as prime when we get to it, that means it is prime.

Before moving on to the next number, we first unmark every multiple of the found prime.
Those multiples can be divided through the prime number we just found, so by definition isn't prime.
We repeat this process until we reach the upper limit.
Every number that is still marked as prime, is truly prime.
By using some math we can do significantly less work while still getting the same result.
