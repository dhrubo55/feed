merge sort is an efficient algorithm, and one of Divide and Conquer algorithms that splits the giving array into two halves, and then merge them in a sorted manner.

The space complexity of merge sort is O(n)
Fast for large arrays unlike selection, insertion, and bubble sort it doesn't go through the whole array many times.

Like I said in my previous blog, the arrow function is not a new concept, it is just a syntax revamp of the regular function in JS. The new syntax is very very easy, it is just a sugar coating around the old function syntax so without wasting anymore time let's start learning about arrow functions!
We are going to discuss 4 different types of functions and we'll transform them from the old rusty ES5 syntax to ES6 syntax. 
4 different types are going to be:

So taking about Blockchain it's a technique to store information in a decentralized manner, in simple words decentralization means no central authority can control the data, for example, Bitcoin is based on blockchain no central agencies can control it. 


blockchain it is almost impossible to tamper data here because due to decentralization if someone tries to manipulate the data it will automatically be noticed by the other.
Miners

Real-life application for blockchain.

In the end, I want to say that, Blockchain technology has far-reaching applications across many industries. Blockchain is already used to facilitate identity management, smart contracts, supply chain analysis, and much more. The full potential of blockchain technology likely remains to be discovered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How does Azure work?



Behind the scenes Azure uses a technology called Virtualization!
Virtualization! separates the tight coupling between the computers hardware and it's operating system using an abstraction layer called Hypervisor!
Hypervisor emulates all the functions of a real computer, such as CPU and a Virtual machine. 
It can run multiple Virtual machine's or (VM's) at the same time.
Optimize the capacity of the hardware and each virtual machine can run any compatible software 

Interesting isn't it?
Let's try to know more about how does it work?



Each data center has many blocks with servers. 
Each server will include a Hypervisor to run multiple virtual machine's
A network switch will be provided to connect all of these servers.
One server from each block will be running a special software called Fabric controller.




Each Fabric controller will be connected to another software known as Orchestrator


Orchestrator will be responsible for everything that happens within Azure
(Including responding to a user's request!) 
Users make a request using Orchestrator's web API
The web API can be called by many tools including the user interface of the Azure portal!

When a user creates a request to create a Virtual machine -> Orchestrator packages everything required for a service. -> chooses the best server block -> Sends the package and request to Fabric controller!
Once the Fabric controller has created a virtual machine -> User can connect to this virtual machine!
You're now familiar about how Azure works in realtime!

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<replace_with_channel_id>
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata]]></summary>
