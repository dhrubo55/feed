A great deal of designers love to invest energy on GitHub investigating the venture, learning a ton of stuff constantly, making associations with different engineers and adding to the open-source projects.

This guide aims to do that for 2021, with the best in class tooling at this time. That said when using modern advanced tooling, you can and will run into some compatibility problems so this guide might be slightly esoteric for you.
This guide is really optimized towards typescript monorepos that also contain packages that can be deployed but really should work for any typescript monorepos.
For this guide, we will be using pnpm but this should mostly work the space with yarn just swap out pnpm workspaces with yarn workspaces. (This will likely not work well with npm and …</span>

                    <span>Distributed applications are a staple of the modern software development industry. They&#x27;re pivotal to cloud storage services and allow web applications of massive scale to stay reactive. As programmers build these systems, they need fundamental building blocks they can use as a starting point and to communicate in a shared vocabulary.
This is where distributed system design patterns become invaluable. While sometimes overused, design patterns are a key skill recruiters are looking for and are essential to stand out in advanced system design interviews.
Today, we&#x27;ll explore 5 of the top distributed system design patterns to help you learn their advantages, disadvantages, and when to use them.
Here’s what we’ll cover today:

Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ll not write a long essay and bore you. If you love simplistic articles that get straight to the point, this is the article you need to understand these hooks. 
The simplest of the 4 hooks I&#x27;m going to explain in this article. useState allows you to have a state variable in functional component. If you&#x27;re confused, it&#x27;s just a normal variable which can make a component re-render when the value of the variable is changed. For example:
import { useState } from &quot;react&quot;;

function demo() {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] &#x3D; useState(true);

  return {isVisible &amp;&amp; 
I&#x27;m visible
};
}

                    <span>It is best practice to hide your configuration details and not include them in version control for the sake of security and independence of project instance. Getting straight to the point here is how to do it using python decouple library.  
Install decouple pip install python-decouple or [https://pypi.org/project/python-decouple/].
Create file named .env or .ini under the route of your project.
Add ignore for .env if you are using git.
Retrieve the settings by importing decouple into the settings.py file and replacing variables to hide with config.
5 . Test the application

If you can manage to have enough customers to be occupied full time, working as a freelancer should make you a significant amount more money than permanent positions.

Nearly everyone touching cloud infrastructure in 2021 is familiar with the Kubernetes project. Put simply, Kubernetes is an incredibly powerful platform for container orchestration. But in my opinion, Kubernetes, more than anything, is a collection of best practices baked into a system that can scale from a Raspberry Pi up to the largest Fortune 500 infrastructure. It empowers developers and operators alike to collaborate through standardized APIs and meaningful abstractions (like a Pod or a ConfigMap).

                    <span>What is Next.js?
It&#x27;s a React frontend development web framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and static site generation.
Server-side rendering?
In a traditional React app the entire app is loaded and rendered on the client. Next.js allow the first page load to be rendered by the server, which is great for SEO and performance.
Next.js other benefits
Easy page routing
server Api routes
Static site generation (like Gadsby)

Create Next.js first project
To install and create a Next.js projet you can use the handy node npx command &#x27;create-next-app my-app-name&#x27;

                    <span>Three point five years ago, Logan was born prematurely, he scared me out of my whits! I remember racing to the hospital doing a speed &gt; the speed limit. I don&#x27;t remember arriving at the car park, only the birthing suite, I burst in to the entrance... The lady said. &quot;Mother and baby haven&#x27;t been very well, I will take you through in a moment&quot;.
I remember the feeling, then thinking, oh god I have lost them, We walked into the hospital together laughing and I will be leaving on my own... 
She&#x27;s taking me in, down some small corridor that felt 10 miles long, I&#x27;m crying now as I write this, as I always do... thinking about this moment, I heard something, it grew louder, we want through the double doors.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>
