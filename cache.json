          "description": "Hello Devs, in this article, I will walk you through the differences between using dot notation and bracket notation in JavaScript objects.\nConsider the following object.\n\nlet animalsList = {\n  cow:{\n    legs: 4,\n    sound: \"moo\",\n  },\n  cat:{\n    legs: 4,\n    sound: \"meow\",\n  },\n};\n\n\nWe can use both dot and bracket notation to access the properties. Make sure that you enclose the key within quotes, when you use bracket notation.\n\nconsole.log(animalsList.cat); //{ legs: 4, sound: 'meow' }\nconsole.log(animalsList[\"cat\"]); //{ legs: 4, sound: 'meow' }\n\n\nAs you can see, dot notation has better readability, it is an advantage of using dot notation.\n\"So, if we can use both dot notation and bracket notation to access object properties, and dot notation has better readability, why do we even have bracket notation?\", you might ask.\nLet's say we have a function, and the key which we have to access is passed to the function as an argument.\n\nfunction myFun(animal){\n  console.log(animalsList.animal);\n}\n\nmyFun(\"cow\"); \n\n\nThe above code will print undefined. \nWhen we use dot notation, JavaScript searches for the key with the exact name we used after the dot( animal, in our case). Since the animalsList doesn't have a property called \"animal\", undefined is printed.\nLet's try bracket notation instead of dot notation.\n\nfunction myFun(animal){\n  console.log(animalsList[animal]);\n}\n\nmyFun(\"cow\");\n\n\nThe above code will work fine and print { legs: 4, sound: 'moo' }, as \"animal\" will be replaced with the respective argument which was passed during function call.\nTo summarize, use bracket notation when you want to access property using variable, otherwise stick with dot notation.\nI hope this article helped you. Happy coding!",

I began it by reading through An Introduction to Programming in Go by Caleb Doxsey. I'm a third of the way through, and I decided that I wanted to share the joy of learning go with everyone. Without furthe ado, let's get started!\nGolang, often shortened to go, is a programming language. It is used to write web servers, client applications, system programs, pretty much anything. It is a great programming language, suited to writing good code effortlessly.\nGoogle, Uber, Twitch, and others.\nThis article describes it perfectly: https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/11/02/go-golang-learn-fast-programming-languages/ at StackOverflow.\nIn this part‚Ä¶",

Recently I took it upon myself to replace an expensive-but-intelligent Gradle task with a cheap-but-dumb JVM app.1 The Gradle task took an average of 2min per build, and my team cumulatively spent 43 hours over the past month waiting for it to complete. The Kotlin app that replaces it takes about 300ms to complete and I project we'll spend the next month cumulatively waiting on it less than 8 minutes. Since time is money, I've estimated this might save us $100,000 over the next 12 months.\nThis is not that story.2\nIt is instead the story of how to build such a thing with Gradle.
