        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, today, we're going to talk about AVL tree.
Sometimes, the Binary search tree's operations become O(n) instead of O(log n) due to being a skewed binary search tree, that's why Adelson, Velskii and Landis. so what's an AVL tree ?

if you're not familiar with binary search tree, this post will help you :)
AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes. 
www.geeksforgeeks.org
The space complexity of the avl tree is O(n)



insert
search
delete




O(log n)
O(log n)
O(log n)



the difference between the height of left and right subtrees can be calculated using this formula below:
BalanceFactor = height(left-sutree) − height(right-sutree)

if the balance factor was less than or equal to 1, the tree is balanced, if not, we use the rotation to make it balanced. There are four types of rotation:
Right rotation
Left rotation
Right-Left rotation
Left-Right rotation 
in the next post, we'll cover rotation types with the implementation, see you tomorrow, have a great day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that you have worked and looked through the posts using higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and reduce(), you now get to apply them to solve a more complex challenge.


Complete the code for the squareList function using any combination of map(), filter(), and reduce(). The function should return a new array containing the squares of only the positive integers (decimal numbers are not integers) when an array of real numbers is passed to it. An example of an array of real numbers is [-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2].




const squareList = arr => {
  // Only change code below this line
  return arr;
  // Only change code above this line
};

const squaredIntegers = squareList([-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2]);
console.log(squaredIntegers);

Hint: 
You will need to filter() the squareList for positive integers (decimals are not integers) and you will need to map()the values from your filter() function to a variable.
Answer:




const squareList = arr => {
  let positiveIntegersSquared = arr.filter(num => {
    if (Number.isInteger(num) && num > 0) {
      return num;
    } 
  })
    .map(num => {
      return num * num
  });

  return positiveIntegersSquared;
};

const squaredIntegers = squareList([-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2]);
console.log(squaredIntegers);

squareList([-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2]) should return [25, 9].]]></summary>

 TensorFlow Lite models can now directly be run on the web in the browser 🎉

So I wanted to see how viable it is to use ML models on device in the browser.
TensorFlow.js is a library for machine learning in JavaScript and can be used both in the browser and Node.js. We can use this library to build, run and train supported models.

It’s been well-documented that the human brain is hardwired for motion. Humans are more likely to pay attention to how elements move rather than focusing on static elements.
CSS animations take advantage of this human behavior. When animation is added to a website, it draws a user’s attention to important areas of a product, creating a lasting effect and generally enhancing experience.
In this post, we’ll review the benefits of CSS animations, different CSS animation properties, and different examples where JavaScript developers can use CSS animations to make websites more interactive and user-friendly.
Each of these examples will be accompanied by a Codepen demo and a detailed explanation to make the examples more realistic, practical, and informative.

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<replace_with_channel_id>
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
