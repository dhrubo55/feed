                    <span>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is the cornerstone of modern software development. While OOP isn’t the only programming paradigm that exists, I would argue it is the most important to have a firm foundation of, and when used correctly, can lead to stronger and more robust software. But what is OOP and how can you make sure to understand it well? Let’s explore.
High Level
At a high level, in OOP there are 3 main pillars to understand for getting OOP down:
  Encapsulation with classes
  Inheritance
  Polymorphism (the most important by far)
Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the ability to enclose data that describes the object and the functions used to manipulate that data into one module container. 
In OOP these are typically called classes and are at the cente…</span>

                    <span>Today I&#x27;m going to show you how you can easily export Issue, Releases, Milestone, Commit History and more from GitHub, using the GitHub Artifact Exporter.
GitHub Artifact Exporter provides a CLI and a simple GUI for exporting GitHub Issues and related comments based on a date range, and it supports GitHub’s full search syntax, allowing you to filter results based on your search parameters.

The CLI also supports exporting:
Commits
Milestones,
Projects
Pull requests, including comments
Releases

And you can export all of that in different formats: JSON, JSON lines, CSV, and Jira-formatted CSV. And of course if you export in CSV, it means that you can open it in Excel. Cool right?

                    <span>Learning a new Node.js framework can be daunting given the speed at which the ecosystem moves these days. Also some of the information on learning new techniques with Node.js is outdated - for example the sheer number of Express tutorials you still find out there! Express is long overdue for a replacement, and Fastify fits right in!  One of the first things to consider when running a Node.js server is how to handle logging the right way. ExpressJS did not offer anything out of the box, forcing another bike shed to paint amongst your team.  Fastify on the other hand recognizes that this is a critical piece of running a server and provides sensible defaults - in the case of logging - the pino logger.

                    <span>Over the last year, businesses were forced to make a sudden pivot towards virtual events, and most were very unprepared for the change. Instead of traveling for business functions and enjoyment, we logged into conferencing and digital platforms and services. The pivot to digital experiences is expected to be semi-permanent, and business are expected to delivery high quality digital experiences for their audiences.
Reaching your market and growing your brand through video experiences doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive, difficult, or time-consuming. In this blog post, we&#x27;ll share how you can host your virtual event using Amazon Interactive Video Service (Amazon IVS). Follow along with this guide.

                    <span>Before we begin with Higher Order Functions and Currying, we need to first establish what a normal function looks like:
function  returnEven () {
    return 2; // returns a single value
}

function  addEven () {
    return 2+2; // returns an expression
}

A Higher Order function is simply a function which returns another function just as a normal function would return a straight value. Since the function has another function in it, it would require at least two rounds of parameters for a higher order function to be fully resolved.
You can use higher order functions to create partially applied functions. A partially applied function is a function which is partially applied and not fully resolved i.e hasn’t received the complete number of arguments it requires (arity) to fully resolve.

How do I slow down the operation speed of a function to the point where I could create visual models and allow the viewer time to process them before it updated to the next step?
Most program languages have a sleep function/method that can be invoked to delay the next operation in a function. For example, Ruby has sleep(1000) and Python has time.sleep(1) to &quot;pause&quot; operation for 1 second, but there is no direct correlate in Javascript.
Asynchronous actions in Javascript can usually call upon one of these two functions. setTimeout allows us to wait a specified amount of time before inv…</span>

What is Snowpack? It is a web application packager that offers :
a rich and powerful development experience
a production mode that offers the features necessary to optimize the assets of the site.




# npm:
npm install --save-dev snowpack
# yarn:
yarn add --dev snowpack

Packagers such as webpack and rollup rely on the construction of a dependency tree that is analyzed and packaged at each modification. The build step of the modified files is still necessary, but the packaging operation (merging the different modules in the form of a bundle …</span>

Given this little object, what should game.play() return to us?
const game &#x3D; {
  lives: 10,
  isPlaying: false,
  gameOver: function() {
    return &#x27;GAME OVER&#x27;

  play: function(){ 
    this.isPlaying &#x3D; true
    return &#x60;It&#x27;s on! You have ${this.lives} lives.&#x60;
  }
}

We look inside the game method and see that this sets our game.lives property to true, and then returns a string, that also lets us know how many lives we have.
So game.play() will run fine.
But what if we want to export just this one method to some other file to run somewhere else. Maybe we have a pause.js file and we want to be able to access this method within it, to start back up after our play after a pause.
If we do something like this we are not going to get what we want

It can be surprisingly simple to add a dark mode toggle to your site, but the challenging part can be making that choice persist for the user throughout your app.  
I&#x27;m using AdminLTE as a template(its free to download and its great), which luckily has a wonderful little class (&quot;dark-mode&quot;) that can be applied to the body to quickly apply a dark theme to the whole site.  Adding a button with the onclick function &quot;toggleDark()&quot; allowed me to access the function I wrote in my site.js file.
function toggleDark() {
    var element &#x3D; document.getElementById(&quot;layoutBody&quot;)
    element.classList.toggle(&quot;dark-mode&quot;)
}

That was really all it took to be able to toggle, once I added the #layoutBody Id to my body element.  Then came the tougher part, making that p…</span>

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>
