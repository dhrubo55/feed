                    <span>Sprites are a vital part of working on a game in Unity. Part of that is how do you go about slicing a sprite that contains multiple images within it. I’m going to spend some time going through a basic example of how to split a sprite and hook it up to an animation 2D platform game! Let’s get started!




To start you are going to need to acquire a sprite sheet from somewhere. Here is a link to where I acquired the platform character for this project.

Once imported into Unity, you are going to need to splice the sprite. You can do this in a number of ways, but I suggest starting by seeing if Unity can automatically figure out each of the images. To do this, use automatic mode as pictured below.

Once finished, you will see a light grey box around each of the images in the sheet. Hit Apply and let Unity work the magic behind the scenes to cut each image into a usable asset. You will know it is done when you can expand the sheet and see each image appended. Something like this:

At this point, you can start making your animations for your character. In my basic example, this just involved swapping the sprites on each possible state to be the correct image.
Pro tip: Expose lots of variables within your Animator so that it’s easy to tell your player how to move!

And then you’re done! You now have an easy way to control your player in code so that you can make a cool game!
I hope this tip helps! Follow me on twitter for more tech tips!</span>

Apply validation to the objects we receive at the endpoint controllers from clients.
What Is The First Solution That Comes To Mind? 🧠


it&#x27;s simple, right? write functions that validate those objects.
Say we have an endpoint to add new Shipments. 🚚
Let&#x27;s start with the DTO classes (Data Transfer Object)
@RequiredArgsConstructor @Getter  
public class ShipmentComponentDTO {  
    private final String productCode;  
}

@RequiredArgsConstructor @Getter  
public class ShipmentDTO {  
    private final String productCode;  
    private final int count;  
    private final List shipmentComponentDTOs;  
}

Now, the controller

Lastly but by no means least, carrying on from my previous blog about website security week, we&#x27;re going to talk about CSP or Content Security Policy.
CSP is Content Security Policy this is one of the most powerful tools in your arsenal to secure your website.
These are two ways to to set your content security policy, either as a header Content-Security-Policy or via a meta tag in your HTML for example:





The content policy is made up of directives (the thing to restrict) and the value(s) on how it can be restricted. We won&#x27;t cover all all the possible directives in this blog but you can find a list…</span>

I was recently accepted into the AWS Community Builders program and have been blown away by how geographically diverse the group is.  The program is split up into different technology-based cohorts--although this is very loose coupling and members are free to join discussions and sessions for any set of technology they are interested in--but there is no location based grouping.  
This led to many asking the same question: are there any other AWS Community Builders near me?
The manager of the program, Jason Dunn, agreed to share some anonymized location data with me and I volunteered to draft a quick proof-of-concept map that would display the locations.

                    <span>Javascript has evolved into one of the most robust languages. Before javascript was just mainly focused on adding some interactivity to the web, but now we are able to build mobile application with React Native, backend with Node.js and even desktop applications with Electron. To take advantage of all this functionality we need to make sure we have our basic Javascript fundamentals down. Today I want to talk about the different data types in Javascript. 
There are two main categories data types fall into with javascript. You have primitive and non-primitive. Why is this important? Depending on its category will determine how javascript stores and references the information. A primitive data types stores a single value and are passed by value. A non-primitive data type can store multiple va…</span>

Our goal is to build a counter and a thing to note is, a component can range from a HTML tag to an entire webpage. Let&#x27;s try and think of the &#x27;components&#x27; or different parts of our counter-app.
First, we have the background and that&#x27;s where everything will be located. Secondly, we have a counter that shows the current count we are on. Thirdly, we have a button to increase the count of the number displayed by one. Lastly, another button to decrease the count number by one.That&#x27;s a simple breakdown of our counter app that we will be making. Let&#x27;s begin.

It offers a free plan which includes a hosted PostgreSQL database. This can be useful if you&#x27;re getting started with a new project.
This guide explains how to quickly connect the Postgres database provided by Supabase to a Prisma project. There are other services out there that provide hosted PostgreSQL databases like Heroku or Digital Ocean.

If only you could actually just start. I kept telling myself over and over that I just need to start something and try new things until I find something I like. &quot;Okay cool, what should I start first?&quot; I ask myself. &quot;How about blogging? What about making content on YouTube, or just social media? ...&quot; That all sounds great, but now I&#x27;m overwhelmed about what to pick.
Instead of doing development stuff, I&#x27;m going to try and make some content around gaming! So I got a camera and made some scenes and spent way to much time setting it all up. By the time I got around to setting up a stream I felt like it was too late, or that my friends didn&#x27;t actually want to watch my content.

                    <span>Scenario:


You encountered a production issue. Immediately you stopped doing whatever you were working on and started fixing the bug. After fixing the bug you observe that you fixed the bug on a different branch. Now you want to move a certain number of commits from a branch A to branch B.
To move a small number of commits from A to B, use the git cherry-pick command
Say, you have the following branches
P ----- Q ----- R ------ S
F ----- G ----- H
(Note: P, Q, R, S, F, G, H are all commit hashes/ids)
and you want to move commits Q &amp; R to B(in front of H). You can do the following by
git checkout branchB
git cherry-pick Q
git cherry-pick R

This will result in
Branch B
F ----- G ----- H ----- Q ----- R
Basically, we first checkout to the branch where we want to add the commits, and cherry-pick the commits we want to move, in the order in which they appear in the first branch. Ensuring that the commits being cherry-picked are in sequential order is important or can result in complications.
Like I said, this method works if the number of commits is small, but to move a large number of commits we can use a better method
git checkout 
  
git rebase HEAD 

So, for the above example - moving Q &amp; R to branch B, the commands would be
git checkout branchB
git rebase --onto H P R
git rebase HEAD branchB

These two tricks should be enough for moving commits between branches.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
