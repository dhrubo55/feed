                    <span>After discussing about Cross Site Scripting Attacks (XSS) in the previous posts, I am going to explain now about another type of attack Cross-site Request Forgery Attack (CSRF or XSRF), sometimes pronounced as &quot;sea-surf&quot;. It has number of other names such as Session Riding, Cross-Site Reference Forgery, Hostile Linking and One-click attack.
CSRF is a more common vulnerability in websites, and the attack sometimes goes unnoticed by the victim. The after effects can be damaging as it happens within an authenticated session, and can perform user actions without the user&#x27;s knowledge. For example, change password of user, one-click purchase on Amazon, post obscene content in the users social platform, transfer funds and so on.

                    <span>If you have used provisioned instances on AWS before, you know that the default metrics monitored are kind of limited. You only have access to CPU utilization, network transfer rates and disk reads/writes. By default, you don&#x27;t have the monitoring of some basic information, like RAM and filesystem usage (which ca be a very valuable information to prevent an instance malfunction due to lack of resources).
In case of GPU-accelerated applications (like Machine Learning apps), this problem goes even further, since you also don&#x27;t have any access to GPU metrics, which is critical to guarantee the reliability of the system (e.g. the total GPU memory consumption can lead to the crash of any application running on the GPU).

                    <span>Dear readers, this post is about a very useful and important concept of JavaScript. I think every beginner should have this basic knowledge while developing any project.
In JavaScript, Promise is a very important concept.The Promise object represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
üëâüèª A Promise is a proxy with an unknown value whenever a Promise is generated. 
success value or reason for failure of the asynchronous operation.
asynchronous methods to return the same values ‚Äã‚Äãas synchronous methods. 
immediately, the asynchronous method returns a promise to provide the value at a particular point in the future.
Promise is a constructor function, so we need a new to create a Promise. It takes a function, as it&#x27;s argument, with two parameters: resolve and reject. 
syntax generally looks like:
const myPromise &#x3D; new Promise((resolve, reject) &#x3D;&gt; { } ) ;
A promise has three states:
i) pending: It&#x27;s the initial state, neither successful nor unsuccessful.
ii) fulfilled: It means that the operation was completed successfully.
iii) rejected: It indicates that the operation has failed.
The resolve parameter is used when we want the promise to succeed. 
The reject is used when we want to catch the failure.
The following is an example of a Promise:
const makeServerRequest &#x3D; new Promise((resolve, reject1) &#x3D;&gt; {
  let responseFromServer;

  if (responseFromServer) {
    resolve(&quot;We got the Data&quot;);
  } else {
    reject(&quot;Data not Found&quot;);
  }
});

In the code snippet, responseFromServer represents a response from the server.
If responseFromServer is true, the resolve method will be called to successfully complete the promise and return the string as it&#x27;s argument. 
Again, if responseFromServer is false, the promise will fail and call the reject method.


  
  
  (Generally it catches the errors).</span>

                    <span>Designing a website starts with defining the role the website is meant to serve, or its purpose.
You‚Äôre guessing right ‚Äì there are different types of websites that are used for different purposes. The three most popular ones are: landing pages, one-pages and classic websites. Obviously, there are also large sites (portals and the like), but that‚Äôs a completely different topic.
You need to know what purpose your website is meant to have. That way the website you‚Äôre designing will be understandable to the users.
If you run a business of some sort, the user needs to know right from the start what you have to offer.
For example ‚Äì you own a car repair garage. The user needs to know they have entered a repair garage‚Äôs website and that they can use specific services.
The purpose of such website i‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>GraphQL is an abbreviation for Graph Query Language.
So, to make things clearer , in traditional REST API, you consume apis using REST and we have done that so many times with Flask, Django and FastAPI by sending different HTTP request methods like GET, POST, PUT , and DELETE to the API using path or URLS 
Now the problem with HTTP requests is that when the request is received from the front-end user, 




The other problem is the opposite, which means that you might want to fetch multiple data or get multiple resources simultaneously, and this is not possible, because there is no enough data per HTTP request.  
And there comes the power of GraphQL
The way this works is by start defining  a schema with objects using type keyword, and a type can have multiple fields like an id, and if you w‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Modules in JavaScript have been around for quite a while but were originally implemented in libraries. An example would be how we can import a React component and make use of it in different components without the need to rewrite the function or class from scratch. Modules help us to avoid reinventing the wheel by writing the same logic twice. It also aids in the separation of concerns; you can have a separate module just for adding numbers or another for fetching data from an API. This way, you know exactly where everything belongs. Imagine if all of Google‚Äôs code was in one single file and every time the team had to fix something in the search bar, they had to scroll through a billion lines of code just to get to that particular section, wouldn‚Äôt that be hectic? Modules help us separate ‚Ä¶</span>

Over the next episodes we&#x27;ll be working on a simple Terminal app.
Modern terminals are very complex but a very minimal one just needs:
a way to input commands
run those commands
show the output
And in this episode, we&#x27;ll ignore the pesky &quot;run commands&quot; part, and just start with styling.
Let&#x27;s just think how we&#x27;re going to represent the terminal. We need some input and some history.

I started my career as a web designer, I learned HTML, CSS, Js and PHP and MySQL, I my got my first job as a web designer on January 2020, they gave me only 9k/mo, my first salary was 9k INR only, and I travelled daily for 3 hours and after job I took the metro and come to home and rest for 5-10 mints and go to gym, because gym is very important. It helps me to reduce my stress and all anger, and after 3 months Corona virus is came and everyone knows that how dangerous it is, and in lockdown I applied for a new job and I got a job in lockdown as a web designer and that company gave me 15k/MO INR, then I started learning Python from YouTube, I learned python in 4months and I practice python at full night&#x27;s and after python I decided to learn Django framework from YouTube and I learned Django in 2 months, and I practiced this for 2 months, and after that I applied for a new job and in December 2020 a company hired me in 18k/mo INR, and after this, but that company was fraud, and after this company I got job offer as a Django Developer and that company hired me in 25k/Mo, I worked there only for one month, because my dad was passed away because of Corona, I ask them for money, for my father but they denied and I leave that company, and in that company there&#x27;s no humanity they are very cruel, but after 2 weeks, I cleared a interview in an International company, and this company is a game changer for my career, they hired me as a Software Engineer and my package is 4.5 Lacs per annum, 32k/Mo. I just want to say one thing that always believe in God, God is everything ‚ù§Ô∏è.

The libraries offer a middle layer too: Apollo Engine, which may be a GraphQL gateway. Basically, there‚Äôs a motive Apollo is one of the leading popular choices for using GraphQL in JavaScript applications. Apollo GraphQL may be a platform that lets us do API calls using GraphQL. It is modern thanks to fetching data because it deals with asynchronous fetching and only fetches the info we actually need. So, there won‚Äôt be needless data that takes up excessive space and our application will load faster.

Apollo is additionally offering exchangeable libraries which may be seen within the Apollo Client Cache. The Apollo Client that one isn‚Äôt prejudiced toward its cache, where the info is kept, by way of any cache advertised by Apollo or its community works. There are already caches available which will be wont to setup a Apollo Client instance.

Interoperability with other Frameworks
Apollo is additionally library agnostic on the server-side, and it offers several solutions to attach with Node.js libraries. Apollo Server for Express.js is one of the leading standard choices among developers and corporations, and there are other solutions for Koa and Hapi on Node.js for Apollo Server also.
