          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

They had an excellent adaptation, communicated assertively and empathetically.\nThey did a wonderful job and we are so proud to have been their mentors. \n(In this photo Karen Rodríguez is missing, who could not be present at the last team meeting, but we still recognize her valuable contributions).",

          "description": "Airtable is a great project management tool for companies. You can set it up to track projects, tasks, team members, and deliverables, but Airtable doesn’t have a great way to share these projects with your clients securely.\nThere are some workarounds for this problem. You can create a shareable link to a view in Airtable, but anyone who gets a hold of that link will have access to your client’s sensitive data. Alternatively, you can give clients direct access to your Airtable base. But because Airtable lacks granular access control, they’d be able to see all your other clients’ projects, too. Finally, you could use a no-code interface builder, but then you’re limited by the features their WYSIWYG editors support.\nIn this tutorial, you’ll see how to build a scalable, secure, and flexible c…",

          "description": "I would like to present you a simple script which I wrote when I needed to merge the passwords database from LastPass to my current KeepassXC database.\n\nLet's start with my example, you want to migrate from LastPass but you already have existing passwords in Keepass.\nThat's why I wrote this script which will merge multiple databases exported in CSV and remove duplikats automatically.\nProHint: If you are esporting a database from LastPass (or other services), add the exported CSV first to the new Keepass database and set the columns you have on your other Keepass database and export as new CSV file. This will make sure you have the same columns in the current database and the new one.\nMy columns look like this: \nGroup | Title | Username | Password | URL | Notes\nTo install and start the CSV database merge you can easily install from npmjs.com\n$ npm install merge-csv-keepass -g\nor\n$ yarn global add merge-csv-keepass\n\nIt is very easy to use, after installation you have access to a new command merge-csv-keepass where you just need to add few arguments and you are done!\nExample, we have a database db1.csv and db2.csv we want to merge them into a file merged_db.csv to do this we run the command:\nmerge-csv-keepass -source db1.csv db2.csv -output merged_db.csv\n\nDone! Simple, isn't it?\nKeep in mind that the script does not check if the output file exists! If it exists it will overwrite it!\nOf course you can add more databases than just two to merge, or even just one database to only remove duplikats from it.\nThe whole project is open source and available on Github.  \n / \n        merge-csv-keepass\n      \n    \nEnjoy your merging! :)",

          "description": "This is a short introduction to relational database design and the Structured Query Language (SQL). Many people organize their electronic data into spreadsheets. This works great if the data is simple, small, and not likely to be tracked for very long periods of time. However, when you have more sophisticated, larger, and long-lived data sets the spreadsheet approach breaks down. In these examples I discuss why this is the case and how to build and query relational databases.\nI use a relational database management system called SQLite. SQLite is one of my favorite tools. It is an open-source, full-featured relational database management system where an entire database is stored in a single file. I also use an accompanying tool called 'DB Browser for SQLite' because it provides a nice user …",

In 2017 things were already heading that way and have only continued on that trend since.\nIf you look at the whole range of build tools we use every framework is enhanced by some build ahead process. And if you want to take it to its natural extent you might land on, as @swyx\n did in his article Language Servers are the new Frameworks, down to a language itself.\nBut there are more steps still to go on this path. This trend of UI Framework in JavaScript being a language goes back much further. Elm(2012), Marko(2014), and Imba(2015) are just handful.
