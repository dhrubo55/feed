One of the most beneficial ways to increase your chances of being selected for a data engineering position is to add well-documented portfolio of software projects to your resume.
It not only improves your skills but also provides a tangible final product you can discuss with your recruiter.
We previously shared an article that looked over 5 examples of data engineering projects you could take on. But what if you want to make your own?
Where should you start?
Often, finding the right dataset is the hardest part of putting together an effective project.
To assist you in your journey of project development, this article will curate a list of data sources that can be utilized for data engineering. I will also outline a few ways that other developers have i…</span>

                    <span>I was recently asked by a developer friend of mine what design patterns I use in my job. The question threw me off a bit because I didn&#x27;t actually know the answer, even though I know that there are definitely patterns that I&#x27;ve used. Do those patterns have names? And why are the patterns I have been using better than others?
For today&#x27;s post, I will be writing down my notes and thoughts as I learn about a variety of design patterns and how to implement them in JavaScript. Feel free to join me on my journey in this post, or make fun of my noob-ness as I discover something I feel like I should have learned already. (Better late than never, right?)

                    <span>How often does a newly patented technology become free and open-source? Not often, right? Well, here is the case. We’ve made our patented Nevod technology free and open-source. It’s hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/nezaboodka/nevod.
Nevod is a language and engine for pattern-based text search. It is specially aimed to rapidly reveal entities and their relationships in texts written in the natural language.
You can try Nevod yourself on the official Nevod Web site. There is a language tutorial and a language reference at your disposal.
The Nevod Web site is also an open-source project, hosted on GitLab: https://gitlab.com/nezaboodka/nevod.web.public
The Nevod project, as well as the Nevod Web site, are licensed under Apache 2.0 License, which includes the patent license. Cool, isn’t it?</span>

                    <span>In this article, we will be doing some common operations while working with JSON data in Python
@rahulbanerjee99

      
JSON unites programming languages { 💻 : 💯 }
#100DaysOfCode #code #CodeNewbies #Python #javascript
    
Let&#x27;s assume we have a JSON file with the following data
[
    {
        &quot;color&quot;: &quot;red&quot;,
        &quot;value&quot;: &quot;#f00&quot;
    },
    {
        &quot;color&quot;: &quot;green&quot;,
        &quot;value&quot;: &quot;#0f0&quot;
    },
    { ... },
    { ... },
]

I have truncated the data but it&#x27;s basically a list of objects with a color and its corresponding hex value.
import json 

path_to_file &#x3D; &quot;data.json&quot;
with open(path_to_file) as file:
    data &#x3D; json.load(file)

print(data)

The output is hard to read, let&#x27;s improve its formatting. There are a couple of ways we can do that

As a matter of first importance, in the past part, I utilized mailgun, not nodemailer. However, when I looked about sending email strategies, I see nodemailer and wanna use it only for the distinction. 
For reset secret word, we need a String variable in the User model. I make a Date variable as well, yet I don&#x27;t utilize it so you can pass it. The String variable is named resetPasswordToken. We need a bundle called crypto, we&#x27;ll require it on top. 
In the User model, we&#x27;ll make a strategy named getResetPasswordToken, in this factor:

                    <span>The Cost of Cloud, a Trillion Dollar Paradox by Sarah Wang and Martin Casado makes two main arguments:
Cloud is the “perfect platform to optimize for innovation, agility, and growth, but it comes at a cost; there’s a ‘flexibility tax’ for the nimbleness the cloud provides.” Therefore, it’s critical to make cloud spend a first-class KPI metric, and empower engineering to optimize from day one.


As a company grows, the pressure that cloud puts on its margins “can start to outweigh the benefits.” Therefore, Wang and Casado present the idea of “repatriating” cloud workloads — bringing all or most out of the cloud.




The short version is: You’re crazy if you don’t start in the cloud, but you’re crazy if you stay on it.

Many junior developers are overwhelmed with edge cases that they will never see. Most of the time, these problems only pop up in interviews, coding golf, or horror stories. Ignoring the click-bait will let you focus on what actually matters.

The best programmers do not worry because they are flexible and adapt to the current situation. When there is problem they chat with their teammates or read resources like books, documentation, tutorials, forums, etc. It’s amazing how many problems can be solved by reading.

Prepare the image container
Having that imagination, the container could be styled as below: 

Calculate the initial scale

The initial scale can be determined based on the widths of container and image:

Now we scale the image to that value by setting the transform style:

Create the range slider
First, we define the minimum and maximum scales and calculate the range step:

It&#x27;s also possible to set the lower and upper values based on the initial scale. I set constant values to make this post simple.
The slider can update the value via the width of left part:

Scale the image when sliding the range
It happens when user drags the knob:

                    <span>Overview


The VSCode IDE implements it&#x27;s language support via the [Language Server Protocol][https://langserver.org/] which is designed to cleanly separate language support from the editor. For Perl a fully functional language server is implemented in  Perl::LanguageServer and will work with any LSP capable editor. 
VSCode can edit both locally or in a remote environment. This brief guide will get you started editing locally (i.e. on your desktop or laptop), however the Perl VSCode extension and Perl&#x27;s LanguageServer will work in either scenario.
Although a Perl interpreter is likely already installed (i.e. system perl) on Linux , BSD, or MacOS the best practice is to leave if for the system to use and install your own interpreter for your development work. On Windows you likely will inst…</span>

In computer science there’s the concept of queues. Queue is the set of messages that are meant to be delivered from one sender to one or more receivers. The messages can be delivered in order or out of order by design. The computer program that handles these transactions is called message broker. RabbitMQ is one the most popular message brokers that runs on top of Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). There are four main components forming AMQP protocol: Publisher, Exchange, Queue, Consumer.
Messages are Published to an exchange by a publisher, Publisher also is responsible for setting the attributes of the message which we will cover later.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

                    <span>Web fonts are often terrible for web performance and none of the font loading strategies are particularly effective to address that. Upcoming font options may finally deliver on the promise of making it easier to align fallback fonts to the final fonts.</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>
