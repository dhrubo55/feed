                    <span>Hello, I&#x27;m Aya Bouchiha, today, we&#x27;re going to discuss switch statements in Javascript.
The switch is a statement used to perform different operations based on multiple conditions (cases)
switch (expression) {
    case &#x27;value_1&#x27;:
        // do something
        break;
    case &#x27;value_2&#x27;:
        // do something
        break;
    case &#x27;value_3&#x27;:
        // do something
        break;
    default:
    // do something if the varaibale does not match any case
}

  we need to know that if the variable matches multiple cases, the code block of the first matched case will be executed.
  case: we use it to match against an expression, If it matches, the code block of this case will be executed. If It is not, The default code block will be executed.
  default: is used to perform some operations if…</span>

                    <span>Over 6 months have passed since I first made this indicator light, and while it was good during previous outbreaks, the increasing availability of vaccinations in Australia means runs of 0 cases is less important. More important is getting jabbed! So I updated my light to track daily jabs!
The New Colour Code:
No data yet: White
Under 25,000 jabs in NSW today: Red
Under 80,000 jabs: Blue
Under 80,000 jabs: Green
100,000 plus jabs: Party Mode!
Just like the original build, finding a data source to use was critical to making it work. Data NSW didn&#x27;t have vaccination data available that I could find and I didn&#x27;t want to go down the path of searching for different API&#x27;s hoping that one would have the data I wanted.

                    <span>Background to the Project 🔎


Having spend some time on my bootcamp working on JavaScript and React, we were given some time to explore our own pathway&#x27;s based on what interested us the most. For me it made sense to start looking at the back-end, with a view to potentially building my first full stack site. 
First I needed to decide which stack to focus on, and after a bit of research I settled on MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and Nodejs). This made the most sense as I already had experience of React. 
The example used in this article refers to a lesson planning project that has similar functionality to a blog site. Once the main features are setup it could ba adapted for many purposes. The user will be able to complete a from with the details of their lesson, access the currently planned…</span>

So, now that the sudoku algo is in place, it would be nice to make it usable. I want to add a couple of things:
Making it pretty - give the display of the puzzles some love
System for inputting sudokus you find online/in RL.
Ability to store puzzles (and solutions)
Ability to have a little demo mode
Diplay how long it took to find the solution.
and a menu system to tie it all together.
First thing I touched - just a small function Sudoku.display_board() to print out the information in a visually pleasing manner based on an example I found through Google Image search.
def display_board(puzzle):
        print(&#x27;\n&#x27;)
        print(&#x27;+-------+-------+-------+&#x27;)
        for y in range(0, len(puzzle)):
            print(f&#x27;| {puzzle[y][0]} {puzzle[y][1]} {puzzle[y][2]} &#x27; +

                    <span>Over the last couple of years, I was privileged to work with many juniors. I have mentored, helped, hired, fired, consulted, read CVs, advised friends and colleagues on hiring juniors, and decided it’s time to write down my two cents on the topic.
This post is focused mostly on junior developers, but I’m sure its content can be relevant to other positions as well.
There are so many juniors out there. Every year we have thousands of new developers finishing their degrees, whether from universities or colleges and let’s not forget all of the bootcamps, online courses, and self-educated people who just go and learn online. We live in an era where most (if not all) of the learning material is just out there - waiting for people to consume it.
Juniors are eager to start their careers, but unfor…</span>

First there was motherfuckingwebsite.com, which taught people how the web was meant to work!
Then some people tried to improve it with bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com and perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com.

I have been a victim of price manipulation a few months ago and decided to share it so that other people don&#x27;t get manipulated like me; however at the end I won 😎
Before anything starts, I wanted to let you know I&#x27;ve hidden as much information as possible to not identify the seller.
So I&#x27;ve ordered contact lenses for myself quite some time ago. I remember the price was around 70 CHF (~ 76 USD) and I&#x27;ve found this price thanks to Toppreise, which is a website to compare prices of a product based on many different swiss shops and sellers.
The fact that the price of the lenses changed upon reload of the …</span>

                    <span>Hi everyone. In this post I&#x27;m going to help you ask for a raise. It&#x27;s important to mention that, I&#x27;m writing this post based on my life experience but also taking in consideration what my tech bubble on twitter answered me (pt-br).
If you&#x27;re working for a nice company that runs performance reviews every three or six month, they probably have a level system, this would be a way of getting a raise and or a promotion.
We know this is the best case scenario but we don&#x27;t live in a pretty word, so we&#x27;re going to see how we can approach the company and have a nice talk (asking for a raise shouldn&#x27;t be messy as appears to be).
This section contains some tips on how you can make a decent approach and ask for a raise.
You need to see the big picture. Why are you asking for a raise? You should never …</span>

                    <span>I have encountered this scenario a few times during installation of create-react-app or when installing react dependencies. There are various solution for this kind of problem. I am listing all of them below in three different stages, try them out accordingly : - 
First Stage
npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/ --global
npm cache clear --force
Delete your package-lock.json file(it will automatically get created after npm i).
Now try for npm install
Second Stage
In your project directory type
npm init
npm update
Restart your IDE
Try installing dependency again
Third Stage
Unistall node and npm
Reinstall node again
These solutions worked for me, and I hope it works for you as well!.</span>

The CSS border property allows us to do several things with the border of individual boxes.</span>
