        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world of tech and software development has created, for quite some time now, a dichotomy. Companies and teams are almost always looking to grow and hire.
Yet, far too often they have interviewing processes that contradict everything they are trying to do.
The technical interview in particular seems broken.
It focuses on the wrong things when it comes to hiring intelligent and diverse developers. 
From my own experiences and observations, it often starts with the technical interview being far too different from what an individual will do on a day-to-day basis. 
Often companies create technical interviews that are in total contrast to what working at that company is really like. They look for specific answers to their questions and if that answer is missing, the candidate fails.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the last article, we saw that at its core, Javascript is synchronous (statements in our code are executed one after the other and we need to wait for a statement to finish execution before moving to the next) and the behaviour of its functions is blocking (if we have an expensive method, until that method doesn't return, no other block of code can run). 
When having complex programs, this behaviour will create problems (in the context of browsers, this means that our browser will be stuck until the blocking function finishes execution). Fortunately, there are ways to fix this by writing asynchronous code. 
ASYNCHRONOUS
In Javascript, we can implement an asynchronous behaviour in a number of ways by using:
callback functions
timeouts and intervals
promises
async/ await (which is just syntactic sugar on top of promises)
The main benefits we gain from using asynchronous programming is that our applications will have improved performance and responsiveness. For example, async programming will help deliver a responsive UI to the users while running a computationally expensive operation, at the same time.
In the next article we'll talk about callbacks and how we can use them to write asynchronous code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the shopping.csv CSV file that we will be working with throughout this blog post.
item,price
rice,2.49
potatos,1.49
pasta,3.79

The goal is to create a one-line bash script that prints the sum of the prices in the file above, which is 7.77.
Step: 1. Print the file content
$ cat shopping.csv

This command prints the file content without modifications.
Output:
item,price
rice,2.49
potatos,1.49
pasta,3.79

Step: 2. Cut the first line
There are many ways to achieve it, but we use the tail +n syntax.
In our case, it takes all the lines until the end of the file, starting from the second line.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2

Output:
rice,2.49
potatos,1.49
pasta,3.79

Step: 3. Cut the first column
awk splits each line by a separator defined by the option -F.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , '{print $2}'

Output:
2.49
1.49
3.79

Step: 4. Concatenate the prices
xargs is used to "squash" the lines into a single string, separating them by space.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , '{print $2}' | xargs

Output:
2.49 1.49 3.79

Step: 5. Replace spaces with pluses
The sed expression replaces the escaped space with + in the entire string (globally - g).
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , '{print $2}' | xargs | sed -e 's/\ /+/g'

Output:
2.49+1.49+3.79

Step: 6. Perform the calculation
bc is a simple calculator that you can use interactively or by piping an equation into it.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , '{print $2}' | xargs | sed -e 's/\ /+/g' | bc

Output:
7.77]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're working with NodeJS applications, you probably has process.env.VARIABLE statements all around your code base. The most simple method to configure an application is installing dotenv and creating that lovely .env file on the root folder of your project.
This approach, however, has some pitfalls and is error prone. What if you don't set that process.env port? You'll probably have a default value (maybe 3000?), but you will need to run your application to discover such type of thing.
That same problem has been solved by typescript for almost anything. When you have the help of static typing, you can discover some errors a lot faster. That said, how can you use Typescript to have a type-safe way to access configurations?
Take a look at that short snippet:
export class EnvironmentService<Environment> {

  public constructor(
   private readonly variables: Environment
  ) {
    // some logic to assign process.env to this.variables
    // you can use, for instance, 
    this.variables = Joi.attempt<Environment>(process.env))
  }

  public get<T>(name: keyof Environment) {
    return <T><unknown>this.variables[name];
  }
}

In a nutshell,
First, you need to define an interface for you environment;
Then, you do pass it as a type parameter to the EnvironmentService class when instantiating a new object;
Finally, use something like class-validator, Joi or you library of choice to assert if the process.env object has all required variables and assign its value to the variables attribute;
After those simple steps, you can use the method get to fetch all possible environment variables with the help of typescript to guide your choice - and if you need, you can cast the value to some desired type:

That's all folks! If you liked that simple content, don't forget to comment and share with someone you might help. Also, that's my first attempt to write something in english: if you see something wrong, just message me on Twitter (@dotmendes
).

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
