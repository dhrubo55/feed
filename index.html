                    <span>AKA is a simple, private URL shortener/bookkeeper for personal use that is hosted locally.
For example, the URL https://long-domain.com/foo/, can be shortened to aka/foo. AKA also allows for sub-routes of shortened URLS. So typing in aka/foo/bar in your browser will redirect you to https://long-domain.com/foo/bar.
AKA provides the same bookmarking that, for example, your bookmarks bar on your browser already provides. However, interacting with your keyboard is faster than interacting with your mouse and GUI. AKA provides short keyboard access to bookmark your most visited websites.
AKA also gives instant access to sub-routes of websites. I&#x27;ve found that when I click on a website on my bookmarks bar, say https://github.com/, I usually have to navigate to some other page that I don&#x27;t commonly go to, like https://github.com/settings/. Instead of interacting with the GUI on the website to find the settings page, I can have aka/gh point to https://github.com/, and visit aka/gh/settings!

React, NextJs, Typescript, Redux.
The ideology of this post isn&#x27;t to write app, its about how powerful is redux with typescript in react of course, and we will use nextjs to write some example api requests. 
First step is so simple
npx create-next-app --typescript

So then we installing npm dependency
npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk reselect

Also you can  delete all usless files.
At first, add folder store in root folder and there create a file index.tsx, consequently folder modules and in this folder we creating another file index.ts, also here another  folder with name App.

                    <span>Hello everyone! Today, I&#x27;m writing a post about how to get started with Blue. Blue is a creative, graphical, and browser-based programming language which makes it easy and enjoyable to get started with programming. First off, you can check it out at https://blue-js.herokuapp.com. Blue is also open source, and its GitHub is https://github.com/i8sumPi/blue. 
In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll be making a carrot catching game, with only 25 lines of code (try it here)

Let&#x27;s start by drawing our main character. We can do this using:
var player &#x3D; new Premade(costume, x, y, size)

We replace the word &quot;costume&quot; with the character that we want, and x and y with the coordinates of where we want to place our new character. 
Blue uses the same coordinate system as Scratch. The x axis goes from -240 to 240, and …</span>

                    <span>p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, researchers, and those who want to enjoy making arts.
In this article we’ll be discussing the two major functions in p5js which are:
  setup function and 
draw  function
And finally, we will do a little practice just to scratch the surface of what we’ll be discussing. Looks a lot right? But it’s quite short and easy. So here we go!!!
To complete this tutorial, all you need is a basic understanding of JavaScript, along with your text editor. With that in mind, let’s get into it!

I am currently on day 2 of learning Ruby going into day 3 and I had trouble understanding what this interesting looking operator does and what you could use it for.  Hopefully by the end of this post, you and I can both take away some practical use cases for this method.
Before we start experimenting with the  operator, let&#x27;s take a look at more common comparison operators.
 1 &gt; 0     #&#x3D;&gt; true     (Greater than)
 0  true     (Less than)
 1 &gt;&#x3D; 0    #&#x3D;&gt; true     (Greater or equal than)

                    <span>This is highly subjective and argumentative. If you think different, please comment!
I love to develop highly interactive and complex apps - that run in the browser. I also think the browser is still the most important tool for accessing them. At least for now. And the next few years. Even on mobile.
If there would be no JavaScript, none of my apps would work. I think this is okay. I haven&#x27;t lost anyone yet, just because it&#x27;s a hard requirement to run the apps. I also don&#x27;t see a valid use-case to disable JavaScript in the browser.
I am also a single person and I don&#x27;t have the money to pay you any computation effort to render a page (SSR). Your browser can do that and it costs you nothing, compared to me. So I push this task to you in such small pieces that it feels all lightning fast (dynamic imports). Lighthouse is my witness. It also wouldn&#x27;t work this way if JavaScript is disabled.
Search engines can&#x27;t find my app&#x27;s deeper content. That&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;s only for members anyway. They still find my index.html and that&#x27;s fine enough for indexing.
I don&#x27;t see any reason to work towards removing JavaScript from my apps soon.</span>

                    <span>Hello guys, In this Article I&#x27;ll tell you something about the python new web API framework - FastAPi Framework.

FastAPI is a new python web framework, FastAPI is modern and very fast, high-performance. FastAPI is used for building web applications and API&#x27;s with Python and FastAPI was released in 2018 and FastAPI mainly used for making the data science applications as well as ecommerce. FastAPI enables the developers to use REST API interface and use many functions to implement them into applications, developers uses FastAPI to create login/Signup, authenticate and create accounts etc.
FastAPI has a great future guys, companies uses this because it&#x27;s very fast and highly securable and it has many feature like security and authentication, Dependency Injection, Unlimited plugins and etc, many big giants tech companies already using this framework for their data science applications and web applications, there are many companies like Microsoft and Netflix, Uber etc. Even my company use this framework, It&#x27;s only 3 years old framework and it&#x27;s already in trend, maybe this framework create thousands of jobs in future.

                    <span>In previous articles in this series, I explained my mental models around understanding 1) what React is and how it helps, 2) the hierarchy of React components on a web page, and 3) how React manages the flow of data.
In all of this, I have avoided getting to the specifics of React code as my focus has been on the concepts.
However, I wanted to get into the concepts of the specifics, that is, the nitty-gritty of React&#x27;s syntax.
A common pitfall of someone who is new to React is to confuse what is a JavaScript thing and what is a React thing.
Hence, in talking about React&#x27;s syntax, we need a mental model for distinguishing those things that are particular to React.
As I&#x27;ve mentioned before, React components are essentially a function that returns a web element.
Let&#x27;s look at an example:

                    <span>It seems like everyone is online these days. The Internet not only facilitates interpersonal communication between users (e.g., email, social media); it’s also a much relied-upon source for all kinds of information. And a convenient means of paying bills and making purchases.
Every single online application has that part with which users interact. When you log onto a website, you are greeted by the welcome page, the menu, site map, and other items that facilitate navigation and utility. All of those items fall under the collective term of “front end.” The front end includes the user interface, which is the part of the website or app designed for the consumer’s use.
We will cover the following topics in detail that will help you get a broader understanding of what exactly front end developm…</span>

                    <span>As you know laravel is a popular framework based on the PHP language. It is a Model, View, Controller (MVC) structure and has many in-built features. So today we will learn the unique validation feature in laravel and how you can implement it in laravel 6, laravel 7, and laravel 8.
There are two ways to add unique validation on email, username, or any other fields. First, we will with the database migration and second with form request.
To add the unique validation in laravel migration, you have to tell the laravel that field will be unique. And you can do this by the unique() method. See the migration schema.
Schema::create(&#x27;users&#x27;, function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table-&gt;increments(&#x27;id&#x27;);
    $table-&gt;string(&#x27;name&#x27;);
    $table-&gt;string(&#x27;username&#x27;)-&gt;unique();
    $table-&gt;string(&#x27;email&#x27;)-&gt;unique();
    $table-&gt;string(&#x27;password&#x27;);
    $table-&gt;rememberToken();
    $table-&gt;timestamps();
});

we applied a unique validation rule with the unique() method and made a username and email unique.
Now what if you want to handle and present the error more user-friendly then you can use the form request validation.
Let’s start with create a form request.
$ php artisan make:request StoreUserRequest

Now, inject the request class into the controller that you just created.
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Http\Requests\StoreUserRequest;
use App\User;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function store(StoreUserRequest $request) {
        // your code here
    }
    public function update(UpdateUserRequest $request, User $user) {
        // your code here
    }
}

Now make a validation rule function in the StoreUserRequest class.
public function rules()
{
    return [
        &#x27;name&#x27; &#x3D;&gt; &#x27;required&#x27;,
        &#x27;username&#x27; &#x3D;&gt; &#x27;required&#x27;,
        &#x27;email&#x27; &#x3D;&gt; &#x27;required|email|unique:users&#x27;
    ];
}

You can also make validation rule for Update case, and Rule class.
