Our goal is to generate a chart that shows the patients&#x27; conditions in a form of percentages, which are calculated based on all the medications they have taken during a specific period.
A patient that is prescribed with 3 medicines:

Aya Bouchiha,
global attributes: are Html attributes that can be used on any HTML elements, like title and hidden.
accesskey: this attribute lets you specify a keyboard shortcut to focus an element.
The way to activate the accesskey depends on the browser and its platform
Code example:

  
Lorem
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing

dir: lets you specify the text&#x27;s direction.

First of all, this tutorial became far longer than I initially intended, so I decided to include this quick summary of the article:
There are various tools and SDKs for Teams app develpment so you need to pick the right &amp; prefered tools!
TeamsFx is a great tool when you build app that uses Microsoft Graph API for fetching data, such as basic user info
TeamsFx handles the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow, getting an access token, and use the token to make Graph API calls
Use the Graph wrapper, client.api(path).get to make the call
Now, proceed to the main content!

                    <span>When building any long-term running process, like a webserver or a program importing data, we should consider providing a way to gracefully shut it down, the idea behind this is to provide a way to exit the process cleanly, to clean up resources and to properly cancel that said running process.
The steps to support Graceful Shutdown in Go consist of two steps:
Listen for OS signals, and
Handle those signals.
In Go those signals are provided by the os/signal package. Starting with Go 1.16 the way I like to implement Graceful Shutdown is by using os/signal.NotifyContext, this function provides an idiomatic way to propagate cancellation when using goroutines, which is usually the case when dealing with long-term running processes.

As the name suggests, the Google Sheets API lets you connect an existing spreadsheet, parse its available data, and pass it to your web application. The latest is version 4.0, which provides the user control over many other properties — such as complete access to cell formatting, including setting colors, text styles, and more. Imagine having a completely free database with an intuitive user interface that helps you view your data and organize it according to your needs while acting as a CMS. How cool is that?
Without further ado, let’s jump right into creating your own CRUD API using the Google Sheets API.

Conseguir o primeiro estágio pode parecer difícil,  muitas vezes nem sabemos por onde começar e é por isso que escolhi compartilhar algumas dicas e um poquinho da minha expêriencia como estagiária.
Quando não se tem expêriencia, a melhor opção é arriscar. 
Há 8 meses eu me candidatei para uma vaga de desenvolvedora front-end sabendo quase nada de programação e sem qualquer preparo. Esperava pelo &quot;não&quot; e estava tudo bem, visto que a minha intenção na época era entender mais sobre os processos seletivos e criar expêriencia em entrevistas. Por fim, acabou que alguns dias depois da entrevista recebi uma ligação avisando que fui selecionada.
Ninguém realmente importa se você faz faculdade em Harvard ou se aprende a programar pelo youtube.
