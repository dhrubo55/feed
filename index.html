                    <span>Hi, this the part 2 of the tree in the data structure, we&#x27;re going to talk about binary tree and its famous types.
Binary tree: is one of the most famous tree data structure which each node should have at most 2 children (left child and right child), in this type of trees, all nodes contains three items which are data, pointer to left child, pointer to right child.
In this type of trees, all nodes except the leaves have two children

All internal nodes have exactly two children and all the leaves are at the same level. 

In This kind of tree, all nodes have only one child.

Like a full binary tree, All levels are filled, but All the leaves should lean towards the left

the absolute value of the height  difference between the left and the right subtree is smaller than or equal 1. | height(left_sub_tree) - height(right_sub_tree) | &lt;&#x3D; 1




All nodes have only one child except the last one (leaf) which hasn&#x27;t a child. It divided into two types: left skewed binary tree and right skewed binary tree

                    <span>Recap


On Day 2 I created the FarmerServce() class that is responsible for making network calls to Firebase Auth Farmer collection and documents. I also created the AddFarmerCommand() class that is responsible for passing an instance of the FarmerServiceModel() to FarmerService().
Today I created the Farmer registration form. This form will accept user input than will create an instance of the FarmerServiceModel() that will be stored in cloud firestore.
Building this form exposed weaknesses in my understanding for Flutter layout and using dart late variable.
Below is a screenshot of the form design followed by the code.

NB: 436 lines of code
class AddFarmerPage extends StatefulWidget {
  static String routeName &#x3D; &#x27;AddFarmerPage&#x27;;

                    <span>Continuing forward. You might learn a lot about the filter method if you implement your own version of it as well. It is recommended you use a for loop or Array.prototype.forEach().


Ex:




var s &#x3D; [23, 65, 98, 5];

Array.prototype.myFilter &#x3D; function(callback) {
  // Only change code below this line
  var newArray &#x3D; [];
  // Only change code above this line
  return newArray;
};

var new_s &#x3D; s.myFilter(function(item) {
  return item % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 1;
});

Answer:




var s &#x3D; [23, 65, 98, 5];

Array.prototype.myFilter &#x3D; function(callback) {

  var newArray &#x3D; [];
  for (let i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; this.length; i++) {
    if (callback(this[i]) &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; true) {
      newArray.push(this[i])
    }
  }
   return newArray;
};

var new_s &#x3D; s.myFilter(function(item) {
  return item % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 1;
});

new_s equals [23, 65, 5]

                    <span>In this article, I’d like to demonstrate how you can deploy a static website with AWS by uploading your website content into S3 bucket, configuring your bucket for website hosting and speeding up content delivery using AWS CloudFront.
First of all, let me explain some of the terminologies.
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a service offered by AWS for object storage through a web service interface. It can be used to store or retrieve any amount of data such as documents, images, videos, etc.
S3 bucket is a resource in Amazon S3. It is a container where files and folders can be uploaded.
Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service offered by AWS. It is used to speed up content delivery and can be integrated with Amazon S3.
Each object can contain up to 5TB of data.

                    <span>In this series of posts, I will discuss coding questions on the LinkedList Data structure. 
Question Link ❓
Possible Explanation 📝
Documented C++ Code 🧹
Time and Space Complexity Analysis ⌛🌌
Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly.
It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.
https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/
💡 Give yourself atleast 5 mins to figure out the solution :)

It is a warm-up question, there&#x27;s not much to explain,
Copy the data of the next node into the given node.
Make the given node point to the next&#x27;s neighbor.
Free up the old neighbor of the given node. 
//Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode
{
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};

#include 
#include &quot;../linkedlist.h&quot;
using namespace std;

/*
-Time:O(1)
-Space:O(1)
*/
class Solution
{
public:
    //! given node isn&#x27;t the &quot;tail&quot; node
    void deleteNode(ListNode *node)
    {
        ListNode *temp &#x3D; node-&gt;next;

        //I can do this only because node isn&#x27;t the tail node
        //and &quot;node-&gt;next&quot; will not null therefore
        node-&gt;val &#x3D; node-&gt;next-&gt;val;
        node-&gt;next &#x3D; node-&gt;next-&gt;next;

        delete temp;
    }
};


No iteration or recursion is done.
No extra space is used.</span>

When its 3D, Maya, Autodesk,and more recently Blender, Unity, Unreal come to our minds. Doing 3D stuffs with JavaScript becomes a point of notice, to only those who come across it, and I did! 
Below are few platforms which use JavaScript to make 3D object or games or even use for rendering. 
They can definitely be of help by integrating in your app or website, or even having fun exploring!
Three
Three (https://threejs.org/ )
Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. You can find some cool games and websites on their official site.
2.Babylon
Babylon (https://www.babylonjs.com/ ) 

Babylon.js is a real time 3D engine for displaying 3D graphics in a web browser via HTML5.Babylon brings in the difference by using HTML5 instead of WebGL.
3.Zdog
Zdog( https://zzz.dog/ ) 

Really cool Round, flat, designer-friendly pseudo-3D engine for canvas &amp; SVG. The tutorial is even friendly and entertaining!
4.Phoria
Phoria (http://www.kevs3d.co.uk/dev/phoria/)

Another great site to find simple 3D graphics on a canvas 2D renderer with some wonderful examples. It is been developed by Kevin Roast and you can find the GitHub repo too.
5.Xeogl
Xeogl ( https://xeogl.org/ )
Developed by Xeolabs, it focuses on 3D visualization in the browser without using plugins! Also does it have various examples to explore!

                    <span>This past few months, I have spent time learning the back-end technologies and how they are working. In this journey, I discovered Mongo DB,which is flexible and allows developers to quickly store large amounts of unstructured data. 
So today we are going to learn how to write MongoDB queries such as:  
CRUD Operations:
Create: insertOne(), insertMany()
Read:  findOne(), find()
Update: updateOne(), update()
Delete: seleteOne(), deleteMany()
More advanced query operations using:
Comparison query operators :  $gt , $lt , $gte , $lte
Set Operators: $in, $all, $nin
let&#x27;s get started 
Create operations:   
Those Create or Insert operations give us the ability to add a new document to a collection. We can use: 
insertOne: inserts a single document into a collection.
insertMany: inserts multiple …</span>

                    <span>I recently published a beta build of Meyda to the npm registry, with the intention of having one of our longest running users test it out to make sure it worked in their project. I hadn&#x27;t done a manual release in a long time, since we use semantic-release, so I skimmed the output of npm publish --help, and figured out what command I would run. I
5.1.7-beta.0, as instructed built the bundle, ran our test suite, and ran npm publish . --dry-run, to verify that the manifest of files that would be published was correct. It was correct, and so I ran
npm publish .

When I checked Meyda&#x27;s page on npm, I was rather surprised to see that 5.1.7-beta.0 had been published as the latest tagged version of Meyda. I had incorrectly been assuming that the magic incantation required to publish a beta package…</span>

Using Async/Await is great, but when working with multiple Promises it often clutters your code with multiple try/catch statements. I wrote this wrapper to easy encapsulate the try/catch and return an array with the data in the 1st index and the error in the second index.

                    <span>Today is the first part of my series on React Select.  This intro is perfect if you are completely new to React Select or React in general.
I started by setting up a base project using create-react-app.  I called my app &quot;demo-app&quot;.
npm create-react-app demo-app
Once my app is ready to use, I installed React Select and got to work!
npm i --save react-select
Now that I have React Select installed, I can begin to use it by importing it and referencing it.

Next, we can add an option to the select in the format of: 
{ value: &#x27;value1&#x27;, label: &#x27;Label 1&#x27;}

Now that we have a simple implementation ready, I used GitKraken to view &amp; commit my changes.
And there you have it! Keep an eye out for my follow-up articles that show you more advanced usages of React Select.
You can view of video walkthrough of this on YouTube!</span>

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>
