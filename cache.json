          "description": "So first of all let me tell you what actually is a JSX !\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  A JSX(JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.\n\n\nHere is an Example :\nconst element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;\n\nIt is pretty similar to HTML syntax. üê±‚Äçüë§\n\nReact embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.\nInstead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù that contain both. ~ React üòé\nThis is what was said by react developers when it was first announced, in my opinion this is a very useful syntax extension to JavaScript, it has made things very easy to configure and manage in a very large code base.\n\n\nIt makes it easier for us to create templates.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  The main difference between HTML and JSX ü§Ø\n\n\n1)  HTML is a Hypertext Markup Language, the standard markup   language for documents designed to display and view on the web in a web browser.\n2) JSX JSX (JavaScript + XML) is an extension of JavaScript that permits you to write down HTML directly within JavaScript\n3) HTML elements have attributes where as JSX elements have props.\nJSX allows us to use attributes with the HTML elements just like we do with normal HTML. But instead of the normal naming convention of HTML, JSX uses camelCase convention for attributes \nTHIS WAS A BASIC PREVIEW OF WHAT IS THE MAIN USE OF JSX, IF YOU WANT TO GO IN DEPTH OF THIS TOPIC THEN CHECK OUT THE FOLLOWING BLOG\nhttps://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html\nBonus Meme üòÇ\n\nHappy Coding üöÄ",

We had started this small project, and about ~4 days it was done. Great!¬†\nThis small project were enough to understand some concepts, and we realize our aim.\nIt depends. In my case, this is just one more hundreds project i've made. but if you need to build a good project, good enough to impress a Technical Leader who's looking for a awesome developer!? or you are just trying your first job? or do you have a loadsa unfinished projects¬†?\nPretty early in any programmer's career comes the realisation that there's more to being a great coder‚Ä¶",

This allows you to reuse your code, control how the components update, and control how they communicate with each other.\nProps allows us to pass data between React components. We can pass callback functions and other pieces of data. We can attach multiple props to each component. Passing props and accessing them is very simple. Lets look at some examples.\nfunction Home(){\n   return(<div>\n      <Greeting/>\n   </div>)\n}\n\nAbove we have a functional component Home that renders a second function component Greeting.
