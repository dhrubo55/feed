I'll be around online after the talk to chat and answer questions.\nIn anticipation of the talk, we've added support for GitLab to AppMap, our open source project which records your code, in your local dev environment, to create and share visual code maps. \nIn this brief video, you can see how to:\nRecord AppMaps in your code editor (VSCode or JetBrains) or with a Chrome browser extension.\nView AppMap visual dependency map and execution trace in the code editor.\nUpload AppMaps to the AppMap Cloud - a place to store and  share them - logging in with GitLab.\nAttach links to AppMaps stored in AppMap Cloud to your GitLab merge requests.\nYou can use this workflow to find out exactly what code, web services, dependency services, and SQL is used in any use case or test case, and how all that code and data fits together. \nThen you can share AppMaps with your dev team so that they can see exactly what you see. For example, exactly how you spotted and fixed a bug.\nCheck it out, and I hope to see you at GitLab Commit 2021!",
