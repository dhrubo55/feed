        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A REST API is an architectural pattern for creating web services. REST is a set of rules that outlines the best practices for sharing data between clients and servers. They use HTTP requests to manipulate data and communicate with web services. REST APIs are stateless, cacheable, and consistent. They're great for building general-purpose and scalable web applications. The three major Python frameworks are Django, Flask, and FastAPI. 
Today, we're going to explore FastAPI, an open-source web framework used to build APIs with Python. 
Let's get started!
We'll cover:
What is FastAPI?
Flask vs FastAPI

Basic FastAPI building blocks

The Virtual DOM was initially pioneered by the React authors on the basis of making delarative JavaScript patterns performant - but how? To understand this, we need to quickly review how traditional DOM manipulation works.
Generally speaking, the easiest way of changing the DOM ("Modifying the HTML") is to mutate the innerHTML property on an element. For example, if I want to add a div element in the document body, I could do something like this:
document.body.innerHTML = '<div>Hello World!</div>';
// <body> now has a <div>Hello World!</div> child.

This seems to be computationally performant, but it really isn't. While the action of reassignment is computationally performant, the DOM repaint ("Updating what the user sees") is not…]]></summary>

We often share a few of these components, to be able to use them across projects. A "design system" for the UI, and some sort of a "toolbox" with util functions, for our logic.
Why, then, do we stop there? Why not share and collaborate on everything? 
Truth is, it's not that easy to share and collaborate on components. You can group components together in the same repository and publish them as a single package, but then, you're not really "collaborating on components", you're collaborating on a project.

Static variables are tied to the Class itself. Each object of a class shares the static variable. 
Non-static variable (instance variables) are tied to the object. In the example below, every object of the Cat class has its own name variable. However, every object shares the catCount variable. 
When you see the static keyword in front of a variable name think of a shared variable.
Class Cat 
{
String name; // Non-static variable (each object has it's own copy) 
static int catCount; //Static variable (each object of the class Cat shares this variable

Cat(String name){
this.name = name; // Non-static variables can be referenced with "this" keyword

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<replace_with_channel_id>
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
