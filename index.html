                    <span>If you&#x27;re starting to apply for your first web developer junior position, then you might want to consider building out one of the 4 (if not all) projects.
Why?
The projects were thought out based on daily tasks that many web developers (including seniors) face every day.
1. Consume API (Backend)

When you consume someone else&#x27;s API, you are talking to a third party outside of your system. You could choose what type of data you want to get, should you validate it, how do you want to store it in your database, etc.
This is where you could throw in your imagination and do whatever you want with the data. You could also perform a small CRUD system once you&#x27;ve retrieved the data.
To give you an idea, you could consume Yelp or SpaceX API (but there is a lot more out there):

NodeJS
NodeJS is a runtime environment that executes Javascript code out of the browser, and it’s commonly used to create back-end. NodeJS is often used with additional frameworks like Express or Nest.js. that can be used in some cases and make the development process much easier and faster. 
Knowledge about these frameworks will be greatly advantageous for your future projects. So start focusing on learning these as well-

                    <span>Hello, I&#x27;m Aya Bouchiha, today, I&#x27;m going to share with you 5 useful &amp; helpful methods from a random module.
Firstly, we need to know that the Random module is built-in in python for helping you to create random numbers.
random(): returns a random float n where 0 &lt;&#x3D; n &lt; 1
import random

print(random.random()) # 0.7291047713945417

randint(a, b): returns a random integer between the given range. a &lt;&#x3D; n &lt;&#x3D; b
import random

print(random.randint(1,  10)) # 7
print(random.randint(-12, 2)) # -10

uniform(a, b): returns a random float between the given range. a &lt;&#x3D; n &lt;&#x3D; b
import random

print(random.uniform(5.7, 12)) # 10.096664083501162
print(random.uniform(10, 100.2)) # 95.00994365426938

shuffle(sequence, func &#x3D; random.random): this method shuffle the giving sequence.In addition, It updates the giving sequence and does not return a new one.
import random

users &#x3D; [&#x27;aya&#x27;, &#x27;simon&#x27;, &#x27;john&#x27;]
random.shuffle(users)
print(users) # [&#x27;john&#x27;, &#x27;aya&#x27;, &#x27;simon&#x27;]

choice(sequence): returns a random element from the giving sequence.
import random

users &#x3D; [&#x27;aya&#x27;, &#x27;john&#x27;, &#x27;simon&#x27;, &#x27;kyle&#x27;]
winner &#x3D; random.choice(users)
print(winner) # aya :)

random(): returns a random float n where 0 &lt;&#x3D; n &lt; 1.
randint(a, b): returns a random integer between the given range. a &lt;&#x3D; n &lt;&#x3D; b.
uniform(a, b): returns a random float between the given range. a &lt;&#x3D; n &lt;&#x3D; b.
shuffle(sequence, func &#x3D; random.random): this method shuffle the giving sequence.
choice(sequence): returns a random element from the giving sequence.

                    <span>Hello readers! 
JavaSript Regular Expressions, also commonly known as REGEX. This is the first part of this series.
Let&#x27;s get introduced with Regular Expressions 📖
REGEX is an object that describes a certain pattern of characters which is used to perform pattern-matching , find, search and replace functions on text or strings. It is also very important when we want to validate emails, usernames or passwords.
The basic syntax of a regex is : /pattern/
A very simple example of searching a regex in a string is, you simply have to write your desired pattern inside the / /.
let testStr &#x3D; &quot;Search the word regex in this string&quot;;
let testRegEx &#x3D; /regex/;

In this introduction part, I want to leave it just to the basic syntax. In the next part, we will learn how to search a regex within a string.</span>

                    <span>Welcome to Day 3 of the JavaScript30 challenge, and today we’re going to checkout some of the most advanced and important array methods in JavaScript.
If you want to know more about JavaScript30, watch the video below and go here




Unlike the last 3 days, today we don’t have an actual project to work on but we do have 8 interesting sets of problems, which we’ll solve using the following array methods –
    filter()
    map()
    sort()
    reduce()

These methods are surely one of the most important and also one of the most confusing concepts, I had difficulty understanding each of them.
But if you’re serious about learning JavaScript, then you can’t escape from them, as they are also commonly used in libraries like React, etc.

When you inspect an element, if you look into the computed section of the styles tab you will see the box model representation of the element.

When you see styles with color, you can click on the swatch which will open the color palette for you.  Open the contrast ratio , green ticks means the color is in the acceptable contrast ratio, red means it does not meet the standard. The colors within the curved white spectrum are the ones which have a better color contrast ratio, if you choose colors outside of it you will notice that the contrast ratio check mark turns to red. Try adjusting the colors accordingly using the color picker to see what works best.

                    <span>Particles animations yeeeeeeh 🎉


I&#x27;ve seen a lot of developers use particles.js in their projects. Everyone likes particles effects, but why keep using particles.js?
Particles.js was a good library for particles animations but when I tried it in late 2019 I&#x27;ve noticed some bugs after some hours, not just particles bouncing themself weirdly, an error in my console.
Particles broke everything when I tried to disable particles movement. Is this bug fixed now? No.
Particles.js is an abandoned project, no one is maintaining it, and some developers are trying to code workarounds themself.
Nice, but I think everyone is already busy enough with their own project and wasting time fixing bugs of 3rd party libraries is not worth it
But every library has bugs, true. Particles.js has 280 open issues,…</span>

                    <span>Python


&quot;Hello World!! Would be a perfect way to usher the world in to the now well known programming language,&quot; Guido van Rossum thought to himself in the 90&#x27;s. 
And in 1991, Python was created as a simple, straight-forward yet a high-level language that is dynamically typed and targets on readability of code It&#x27;s main purpose is to let you work quickly and integrate systems effectively. Python involves essential and object-oriented programming with wide-ranging and great typical library that has regular memory.
1. Easy to Read, Learn and Write
2. Improved Productivity
3. Interpreted Language
Python shows only one error even if the program has multiple errors. This makes debugging easier.
4. Dynamically Typed
5. Free and Open-Source

                    <span>I have recently implemented the frontend side of an online payment system, and surprisingly it was not as complicated as I had thought. I confess Stripe handled most of it.
The Forntend Side

npx create-react-app react-stripe
cd react-stripe
yarn add @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/react-stripe-js axios

Next, we need to create a Stripe account to get the publishable key that we’ll use to integrate Stripe into our project.
Note: Stripe has two modes, a test mode for development and a live mode for production. Each mode has its secret and publishable keys. Secret keys are for the backend code and should always be private. Publishable ones are for the frontend code, and they are not as sacred as the secret ones.
Now, to configure Stripe, we need loadStripe from @stripe/stripe-js, E…</span>

                    <span>FlatMap is a single method which can be usable for flat and map methods.
As you know flat(), flattening the 1-level deep and map() to loop into an array.
If we include both, we called flatMap() 😉 
So, instead if calling two methods flat() and map(), you can use single method called flatMap().
let plants &#x3D; [&#x27;💐&#x27;, &#x27;🌲&#x27;, &#x27;🌻&#x27;, &#x27;🌹&#x27;];

// ❌ map + flat
plants.map(plant &#x3D;&gt; [plant, &#x27;🍁&#x27;]).flat();
// Output
//[&quot;💐&quot;, &quot;🍁&quot;, &quot;🌲&quot;, &quot;🍁&quot;, &quot;🌻&quot;, &quot;🍁&quot;, &quot;🌹&quot;, &quot;🍁&quot;]

// ✅ flatMap
plants.flatMap(plant &#x3D;&gt; [plant, &quot;🍁&quot;])

// Output
// [&quot;💐&quot;, &quot;🍁&quot;, &quot;🌲&quot;, &quot;🍁&quot;, &quot;🌻&quot;, &quot;🍁&quot;, &quot;🌹&quot;, &quot;🍁&quot;]

📝 FlatMap() always do first map() and then it flat().
In flat(), we use to pass arguments where you set the depth, arguments define how deep a nested array should be flattened.
let plants &#x3D; [[[&quot;🌻&quot;, &quot;🌹&quot;]]];
plants.flat(2);

// [&quot;🌻&quot;, &quot;🌹&quot;]

flatMap() do only 1 level deep flattening.





let plants &#x3D; [[[&quot;🌻&quot;, &quot;🌹&quot;]]];
plants.flatMap(plant &#x3D;&gt; [plant]);

// [[&quot;🌻&quot;, &quot;🌹&quot;]]

Yes, You can also do filter here using flatMap().
let arr &#x3D; [5, 4, -3, 20, -4, 18]
arr.flatMap(i &#x3D;&gt; {
  return i &lt; 0 ? [] : [i];
})

// [5, 4, 20, 18]

MDN Docs of FlatMap
flatMap() method always helps if you want to use map and flat methods both together.

                    <span>Microsoft just introduced Windows 365, a new service that let company cut partners out of the money marking loop by providing virtual PCs to all they customers.
Windows 365 will only be available for businesses when it launches on August 2nd, with a pre-user monthly subscription cost. Microsoft is not detailing exact pricing details until the launches next month, but Windows 365 is designed for one-person businesses all the way up to enterprises with thousand of employees. 

low-end
While Windows 365 seems perfectly timed for businesses looking to tackle the complexities of remote work, Microsoft has been working on the service for years. the OS group at Microsoft had been working on a project codenamed &quot;Arcadia&quot;, a service to stream video games from the cloud. Arcadia dates all the way back to Microsoft demonstrating Halo running on a Windows Phone in 2013. This early virtualization work eventually led to Windows 365 and a focus on making it consumer-friendly. 
&quot;When we built this team, we brought in a couple of leaders who had experience with virtualization, but for the most part we brought in people who had experience with Windows and experience with consumer experiences because that was the bar we wanted to set,” says Scott Manchester, director of program management for Windows 365.
Also because of the pandemic, the work on Windows 365 and Microsoft&#x27;s broader focus on hybrid has been accelerated. Microsoft has steadily improving Microsoft Team over the past year and laying out it vision for the future of meeting, remote work, and so much more.

While Windows 364 has the potential to dramatically change how computing takes place in commercial settings, there&#x27;s nothing inevitable about it. many will object to ceding the privacy of a local box to the servers of Microsoft. Windows 365 might just be the first significant step toward a future where you don&#x27;t need a dedicated Windows PC to use Windows.</span>

OpenShift, created by Red Hat, is the platform large enterprises use to deliver container-based applications. If you have read my previous posts about Docker and Kubernetes, you understand the importance of containerization in the cloud. OpenShift claims to be “the industry&#x27;s most secure and comprehensive enterprise-grade container platform based on industry standards.” To put it bluntly, OpenShift is like Kubernetes on steroids.

Say you’ve just finished an ambitious project and want to write about 10 important lessons you’ve learned as a developer during it. You should definitely blog it—I love that kind of blog post, myself. Making a jump into the technical debt of operating your own blog isn’t a small choice, but it’s important to own your own content. With Hashnode, the decision gets a lot easier. You can blog under a site you entirely own, and at the same time, reap the benefits of hosted software tailor-made for developer blogging and be part of a social center around developer writing.
