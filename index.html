As a convenience, I will decode the bytes to a string and log the result to the console.

                    <span>To create table in SQL you have to use following syntax
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_1 datatype,
    column_2 datatype,
    column_3 datatype
);

It&#x27;s important to place comma after each column definition, and semicolon after whole statement.
Here&#x27;s real life example:
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    surname VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    password VARCHAR(255)
);

This statement creates table with 4 columns. First one is of type INT which means integer value. The other 4 columns are of type VARCHAR(255) which means TEXT with maximum length of 255. You can place any number in brackets to define length.</span>

                    <span>When working with React a lot of people expect state changes to reflect immediately both in a class and functional component with React hooks.
This, however, is not the case.
State updates using this.setState or useState do not immediately mutate the state but create a pending state transition. Accessing state immediately after calling the updater method can potentially return the old value.
There is no guarantee of synchronous operation of state update calls and multiple state updates can be batched for performance reasons.
State updates alter the virtual DOM and cause re-rendering which may be an expensive operation. Making state updates synchronous could make the browser unresponsive due to huge number of updates.
To avoid these issues a careful choice was made to make state updates asy‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Well, Hi there! This is my first Dev.to post, and I&#x27;m really excited to begin here! üòÅ
Perhaps, you already know me from my Tumblr, or my Medium. But nice, and original content will be written here, so take a seat!
To start off, I decided to share a little piece of mathematical knowledge, that, although simple, it is very common to forget, or simply don&#x27;t come across. But is very useful, and, if you want to follow the path of machine learning, for instance, it is a must know basic concept.
So let&#x27;s jump in!
O.b.s: I&#x27;m assuming you already know the base concepts of statistics. Such as average, mode and median.
You can think variance, just like the average means like the &quot;center&quot; of the data, variance can mean how the data actually behaves around that &quot;center&quot;.
For instance, let&#x27;s take the mean of these table, which show how many hours of sleep Greg had last week:



Week day
Hours Slept




Monday
7 hours


Tuesday
8 hours


Wednesday
6 hours


Thursday
0 hours


Friday
7 hours


Saturday
7 hours


Sunday
10 hours



This data gives as a average of: 7,6 hours slept per night.
But, let&#x27;s change the question here, and if we want to know Àúhow constantÀú is the sleeping behavior of Greg?
So, now we want to know, having an average behavior of 7,6 hour slept/night, how constant was these hours?
Variance is defined by:
Œ£(average - x)¬≤ / n 

-&gt; x being the hours slept.
-&gt; n being the amount of data.

So, the example above would evaluate to:
(7-6.42)¬≤ + (8-6.42)¬≤ + (6-6.42)¬≤ + (0-6.42)¬≤ + (7-6.42)¬≤ + (7-6.42)¬≤ + (10-6.42)¬≤

which would result: 10.38
Now that you understood variance, the standard deviation, is used to minimize the noise made by the ¬≤&#x27;s on variance&#x27;s formula.
Calculate de SD by: sqrt(variance)
In our case, it will be: 3.22
If you&#x27;re a little advanced in Maths, you can think of variance as the value of a function y, and the SD being the derivative of the same function. üòâ
Both have lots of use-cases, that I pretend to bring here on future posts. Hope it helps! üòÅ</span>

How I structured the files in the project for better documentation: every file in the same folder; 
How I coded a &quot;query builder&quot; to handle different calls without repeating code: using a generic parameter;
How I coded test cases within the documentation: nothing special, just remarks on async tests;
How I created High Order Functions (HOF) to emulate that behaviour we have in Rust&#x27;s Option and Iterator, for example: created a struct with functions that return the struct itself;
How I used serde to deserialize the Json: nothing special, just some extra remarks;
How I tested it as if it were a crate without exporting it to crates.io: just add the lib.rs in the dependencies of the new project.

                    <span>Have you encountered a challenge where you need to fetch records from the database in no particular order using Laravel?
I found myself at this point once and here is how I solved it. All thanks to dear Google!üòç
This is a regular SQL query to fetch records randomly:
select * from &#x60;users&#x60; order by RAND() &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;



But in Laravel, there is a method named

 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;inRandomOrder()&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

 which simply fetches the records in random order.

Here is a list of the few ways this method can be used:




&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;PHP

//Fetch all records in random order
Model::inRandomOrder()-&gt;get();

// 5 indicates the number of records
Model::inRandomOrder()-&gt;limit(5)-&gt;get();

//Fetc all records in pages or sets of 6
Model::inRandomOrder()-&gt;paginate(6)-&gt;get();

// get one random record
Model::inRandomOrder()-&gt;first()

The helper method can also be used like this:
Model::where(&#x27;name&#x27;,$name)-&gt;inRandomOrder()-&gt;get();

PS: The inRandomOrder() method can also be used alongside other helper methods for fetching records like paginate() and limit().
I trust this will be of great assistanceü•∞. I would also love to learn more about this so please feel free to drop your comments or send a direct message on  twitter.
Thank youüòé</span>

                    <span>As a back-end engineer, dealing with forms is almost inevitable. I&#x27;ll be doing a short guide on how to use Form Requests to validate data requests in Laravel 
The prominent way of validating data requests in Laravel is by  using the validate method or validator facade in our controller like this:


Now there is absolutely nothing wrong with this method but think about scenarios where you need to perform a validation logic more than once, this is one advantage of Form Requests.
So, what are Form Requests?
One more benefitüòç is that you can also customize your validation error messages. Amazing right?üòâ 
I&#x27;ll be creating a basic User Registration API with Form Requests Validation, so follow through carefully.üëå

                    <span>Vim and BASH?


Bash Scripting is a powerful skill to have as a programmer because we find Linux almost everywhere and to get through it you must have a command over its interface which is generally the BASH shell. Vim is a great option for doing this, or probably the best out there! Because Vim is pre-installed in almost every Linux distribution. This is not an in-depth setup for BASH on Vim, it is a simple editorial on starting up BASH scripting on the Vim editor. So without wasting time on &quot;Vim features&quot; let&#x27;s dive in with the setup for BASH in Vim.
Setting up a bash script doesn&#x27;t require much code but still in some cases it can be a bit hassle and to avoid the repetitive task, one can easily set up a macro for the boilerplate BASH script.

                    <span>Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed üì∫ Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos üôÉ
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>
