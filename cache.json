          "description": "Writing code, it's easy to make mistakes. A misspelled word on occasion, forgetting a closing tag in an HTML file, The smallest of mistakes can be hidden once the application becomes large enough. Recently, I found out about a plug-in called emmet that seems like it could possibly cut down on lines of code that I would've normally typed out manually, resulting in less mistakes. So far it seems like a plug-in that I will be making great use of in the future. \nOne cool thing emmet allows you to do is seen when writing out tags. If you wanted a simple pair of div brackets normally you'd type them out.\n<div></div>\n\nUsing emmet you simply type out the word div, press enter and the result would be the same. \n\nAnother great thing about emmet is that if you wanted to give the element or a class you can do that as well.\ndiv#blach\n\nwould give us\n<div id='blah'>\n<div> \n\nOnce again, less typing less chance of an error on your part. You can even to the same with a class as well.\ndiv.blach\n\nwould give us\n<div class='blah'>\n<div> \n\nIf you're familiar with CSS you may notice similarities in how one would tell emmet we want an id or class vs a CSS declaration of an id or a class as well. As stated before, I'm in the early stages of purposefully using emmet, so I'm learning it all as I go. I wanted to share what I've learned and maybe point other beginners in the right direction. Finding cool things like this keeps me at my computer and excited for what I may find next. Happy Coding!",

Most research projects are unfinished, outdated, and so unpractical it has no use in real life.\nWeb development needs a lot of improvement in the research space. This allows other researchers to gain insight into new technologies -- in my case, JavaScript libraries. We need more representation to explore more interesting topics, like WASM, compiler-based frameworks, and worker-based libraries.\nSo... what should you take away from this? Well, if you have a substantial, practical, and useful library in the web development space, develop a research project in parallel to contribute to the great world of science.",

          "description": "This section is all about the best JavaScript libraries for handling date and time. These libraries are used to simplify and handle the complexity of dates and times in JavaScript. There are many advantages to using these JavaScript libraries which include the fact that they can help you with parsing, formatting, and setting a wide variety of date/time formats.\nThe most popular JavaScript library for handling date and time is Moment.js. Other libraries for handling date/time include:\n-date-fns - this library provides you with a large amount of functions for working with dates\n-moment - this library has been deprecated but it still remains one of the most popular\n-datejs - this library provides you with a simple interface to work with dates\n‚Äî\nDates and times are essential in a variety of fields. JavaScript has a lot of libraries to help programmers handle these two concepts better.\nThe JSS date library is the most popular one used for date handling. It is open-source and provides a lot of options for developers who need it. The library provides methods for parsing, formatting, manipulating, and generating dates, as well as handling time zones and calendars.\nThis JSS library can be used with other JavaScript frameworks like Angular, React or Vue just by including the library with the respective framework package manager (NPM or Yarn).",

          "description": "How to add content recommendations to website\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Show users what they want (even though they don‚Äôt even know what they want)\n\n\n\nPersonalized content proposals are now an established element of the Web. Most social media serve content to their users based on multiple touchpoints of the user‚Äôs interaction with the platform. (Some of them also track the user outside their pages, which has caused a whole discussion about privacy and blocking cross-domain tracking.) Usually, the aim is to increase some interaction rate (i.e. measured by the number of visits, purchases or other actions per user).\n\nOnline shops increase their revenue with clever recommendations of products that appear at every stage of the sales funnel. But non-retail sites can also benefit from the advantages of recommender systems. If you run a website that provides content, you can use content recommendations to maintain user attention and increase visits.\nIn this article, using an example of a movie database web site, I‚Äôll show you how to add content recommendations to your website. We‚Äôll discuss basic approaches to this and then use a SaaS called Pipeless, which allows you to create a database with built-in recommendation algorithms.\nRead More:\nhttps://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-add-content-recommendations-to-a-website-be107c336117",
