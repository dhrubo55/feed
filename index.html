                    <span>Ever wondered how to implement page routes in a complex react application?

worry not cuz i ve&#x27;gat a solution for y&#x27;all
an npm package @dev_hills/easyroutes ,it makes routing between pages as easy as easy!!
npm i @dev_hills/easyroute and you are all set-up, it accepts a single prop which is basically an array of objects.
//[{path:&quot;/about&quot;,component:&quot;About&quot;}]
you can as well pass in any number of objects to the array , thats all you need as property to get up and running with this cool package ..
check it out guys</span>

                    <span>Hi, today, I&#x27;m going to talk about ridiculous sorting algorithms which are called Bogo sort
Bogo sort: called also stupid sort, slow sort, monkey sort is a type of sorting algorithms, it works by shuffling randomly array elements until the array is sorted.
Time complexity: 



 Best case: O(n)
 Average case: O(n!) 
 Worst case: infinte ( because there is no guarantee that a randome suffling will ever produce a sorted array )
The space complexity of Bogo sort is O(1)
for getting a random integer to shuffle the array we need to import randint from the random module
from random import randint

def shuffle(arr: list):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        randomInt &#x3D; randint(0, len(arr) - 1)
        arr[randomInt], arr[i] &#x3D; arr[i], arr[randomInt]

we should implement a function that checks if the array is sorted, if the function returned True, It means the array is sorted and we need to break the loop, else (returned False) we&#x27;ll shuffle it again until the array will be sorted.
def isSorted(arr: list) -&gt; bool:
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        if arr[i] &gt; arr[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True

this function shuffles the array randomly until it is sorted.
def BogoSort(arr: list) -&gt; list:
    # while the array is not sorted
    while not isSorted(arr):
        shuffle(arr)
    # if the array is sorted
    return arr

from random import randint

def isSorted(arr: list) -&gt; bool:
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        if arr[i] &gt; arr[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True

def shuffle(arr: list)  :
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        randomInt &#x3D; randint(0, len(arr) - 1)
        arr[randomInt], arr[i] &#x3D; arr[i], arr[randomInt]

def BogoSort(arr: list) -&gt; list:
    while not isSorted(arr):
        shuffle(arr)
    return arr

Have an amazing day!

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve read my previous blogs then you&#x27;re aware that I have been learning Next.js recently as I tackle my next project, WatchNext. If you have not read my previous blogs, a quick update for you: I kickstarted a new project to keep the gears in my brain spinning as I search for my first engineering role. During the kickoff process, I quickly encountered an obstacle (I wanted this projet to be frontend only). That obstacle being, how to properly hide my keys on a frontend application without them accidentally being exposed to a client after deployment. Nicholas Papadakis recommended using Next.js and thus my journey to learn it began.
Now that we&#x27;re caught up let&#x27;s get to the point of this blog. API KEYS!

                    <span>If you’re having problems managing different ssh keys for your different git accounts, This article is for you! follow below steps to do it easily.
Requirements: Nodejs, Npm
You will need to install and use npm package called ssh-keyman. (Click here to view docs)
Run below command to install ssh-keyman package.
$ npm i -g ssh-keyman

Now initialise ssh-keyman using below command
$ ssh-keyman -i

By running above command, this package will setup everything up in your system. It will create a default environment in your system &amp; copy your current ~/.ssh/ content to default environment.
Now let’s assume we‘ve two different repositories from two different github profiles githubx and githuby.
Now let’s create two environments, One for githubx and other for githuby.
$ ssh-keyman -c githubx

                    <span>The Richest Man in Babylon was first published in 1926, almost one hundred years ago. We might think about it as the father of all modern personal finance advice books.
Especially if we consider that it&#x27;s based on a collection of parables that were written 4,000 years ago in the ancient city of Babylon, the richest city in that world.
They understood some basic correlations that many still get wrong. Now, let&#x27;s see some of the main ideas.

If you are dedicated you can read the book in one afternoon, it&#x27;s only about 120 pages. Due to obvious reasons, I&#x27;m only going to highlight 2 sets of rules and a story.
When Sargon, the King of Babylon returned from war, he saw that his people couldn&#x27;t support themselves.

A sigla ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) significa Aplicações para a Internet Ricas em Acessibilidade, que definem as formas de tornar o conteúdo e as aplicações da internet mais acessíveis.
A ARIA permite a marcação de algumas regiões importantes na página que servirão para auxiliar na navegação (para ajudar quem usa um leitor de tela, por exemplo). É um conjunto de atributos especiais para acessibilidade que pode ser adicionado a qualquer linguagem de marcação, mas é especialmente adequado para o HTML, e todos os exemplos que trarei serão nessa linguagem.

                    <span>Have you ever tried to merge a Pull Request and it seems to have a conflict on file that you changed intentionally?
When it comes to conflict resolution, it can be a painful experience sometimes, even when you all you’re doing is accepting the incoming changes.
Git can be intimidating sometimes, and most people tend to prefer a GUI to manage their versioning and source control. But sometimes using the CLI can be the better option.
I’m the kind of weird that likes to do things on the CLI when possible, so I have a small life-hack that has saved me so much time during conflict resolution.
In this example we are going to imagine we are trying to make a PR from development to staging, once you’ve created the PR you notice there is a few conflicts and the PR can’t be merged right away. Don’t panic, we can fix this with the power of the CLI! 
Make sure you have the latest version of your destination branch (in this case staging) checked out on your local environment.
Go to your source branch (in this case its development) and run: 
git pull origin staging —strategy ours
This will accept the history of the source branch over the destination branch and resolve the conflicting files  for you. Now you can safely push the resolution to your remote and the PR you submitted should now be mergeable.
The CLI can be an intimidating place, but sometimes it can be the fastest way to achieve a task. Merge strategies are one of the most powerful options you can use from the git source control system, and there’s many more strategies that allow you to get even more flexibility from these options, I’ll leave a couple of links below where you can learn more about git merge strategies, thanks for reading!

                    <span>Welcome to the first vue academy ! It will be a list of lot of article on vue! I have 2.5 years of experience in this and I can teach a few thing about this ! 
For this course we will focus on scoped attribute in CSS.

    .toto {
        color: blue;
    }



    
 Hi 
.

    .toto {
        color: blue;
    }


CSS will be applied to the elements of the current component only. This is similar to the style encapsulation found in Shadow DOM.
When you will compile your code, the code above will be equal to

    .toto[data-v-f3f3eg9] {
        color: blue;
    }



    
 Hi 


As you can see it&#x27;s very simple &amp; basic but very strong. Vue will inject an attribute on the scoped class and apply this attribute on each element that include the scoped class !.</span>

I just want to share with you why I decided to move to WebStorm and why I&#x27;m still using it and maybe you could consider using it too!.
The first reason why I decided to start using WebStorm is because I changed my computer, and as a developer with a lot of work I needed to start coding as fast as I could, so I downloaded VsCode because that was the editor which I used to use, then I realised that I did not have all my plugins that I had in my previous computer (obviously) and I did not even remember their names, it was very frustrating.

                    <span>In this blog, I’m going to talk about Containment, Specialization and Inheritance in React-Native/React, the difference between them and how you can use them to reuse your code.
First, while the examples shown below are related to react-native, the theory is also applicable to react. The concepts might help you to go DRY. Let’s discuss these points one by one.
When you wrap your component(s) within a higher-order component, it’s a containment. Some components don’t know their children ahead of time. Some common cases are Sidebar, Dialog. And for the sake of reusability, some components better be generic.
The following problem can make this clear:
We have a table of n rows and two columns. The columns can hold not just the text but any other JSX component (Button, Image, Icon) too. However,…</span>

                    <span>Probably there are hundred or thousands of articles on how to install Linux but I made this mainly for myself, but maybe you find it useful too.
I will show you how to do it in 5 simple steps. The steps are almost the same for every popular distro.
First of all you will need a pendrive. Without one we can&#x27;t do so much... 
Download a program to create bootable USB drive. There are many programs for that, here are some of them: UNetbootin, Rufus, Etcher, Linux Live USB Creator and there are many more.
Not all of them are for all Operating Systems so you will need to check if they are available for your OS. For example, UNetbootin if for Windows, Linux or Mac OS but Rufus is only for Windows.
Once you picked the program you like, download it and install it in your Operating System.

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
