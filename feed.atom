CSRF is a more common vulnerability in websites, and the attack sometimes goes unnoticed by the victim. The after effects can be damaging as it happens within an authenticated session, and can perform user actions without the user's knowledge. For example, change password of user, one-click purchase on Amazon, post obscene content in the users social platform, transfer funds and so on.

You only have access to CPU utilization, network transfer rates and disk reads/writes.

In case of GPU-accelerated applications (like Machine Learning apps), this problem goes even further, since you also don't have any access to GPU metrics, which is critical to guarantee the reliability of the system (e.g. the total GPU memory consumption can lead to the crash of any application running on the GPU).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear readers, this post is about a very useful and important concept of JavaScript. I think every beginner should have this basic knowledge while developing any project.
In JavaScript, Promise is a very important concept.The Promise object represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
👉🏻 A Promise is a proxy with an unknown value whenever a Promise is generated. 
success value or reason for failure of the asynchronous operation.
asynchronous methods to return the same values ​​as synchronous methods. 
immediately, the asynchronous method returns a promise to provide the value at a particular point in the future.
Promise is a constructor function, so we need a new to create a Promise. It takes a function, as it's argument, with two parameters: resolve and reject. 
syntax generally looks like:
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { } ) ;
A promise has three states:
i) pending: It's the initial state, neither successful nor unsuccessful.
ii) fulfilled: It means that the operation was completed successfully.
iii) rejected: It indicates that the operation has failed.
The resolve parameter is used when we want the promise to succeed. 
The reject is used when we want to catch the failure.
The following is an example of a Promise:
const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject1) => {
  let responseFromServer;

  if (responseFromServer) {
    resolve("We got the Data");
  } else {
    reject("Data not Found");
  }
});

In the code snippet, responseFromServer represents a response from the server.
If responseFromServer is true, the resolve method will be called to successfully complete the promise and return the string as it's argument. 
Again, if responseFromServer is false, the promise will fail and call the reject method.


  
  
  (Generally it catches the errors).]]></summary>

You’re guessing right – there are different types of websites that are used for different purposes. The three most popular ones are: landing pages, one-pages and classic websites. Obviously, there are also large sites (portals and the like), but that’s a completely different topic.
You need to know what purpose your website is meant to have. That way the website you’re designing will be understandable to the users.
If you run a business of some sort, the user needs to know right from the start what you have to offer.
For example – you own a car repair garage. The user needs to know they have entered a repair garage’s website and that they can use specific services.

So, to make things clearer , in traditional REST API, you consume apis using REST and we have done that so many times with Flask, Django and FastAPI by sending different HTTP request methods like GET, POST, PUT , and DELETE to the API using path or URLS 
Now the problem with HTTP requests is that when the request is received from the front-end user, 




The other problem is the opposite, which means that you might want to fetch multiple data or get multiple resources simultaneously, and this is not possible, because there is no enough data per HTTP request.  
And there comes the power of GraphQL

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modules in JavaScript have been around for quite a while but were originally implemented in libraries. An example would be how we can import a React component and make use of it in different components without the need to rewrite the function or class from scratch. Modules help us to avoid reinventing the wheel by writing the same logic twice. It also aids in the separation of concerns; you can have a separate module just for adding numbers or another for fetching data from an API. This way, you know exactly where everything belongs. Imagine if all of Google’s code was in one single file and every time the team had to fix something in the search bar, they had to scroll through a billion lines of code just to get to that particular section, wouldn’t that be hectic?
