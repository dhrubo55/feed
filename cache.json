In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.\nLexical scope is the ability for a function scope to access variables from the parent scope.

Of course, you have, and chances are it was made using Javascript. But creating 3D objects with pure JavaScript requires a large amount of code, and might now always work in React environments. Not to say it isn't possible! However, with the implementation of react-3d-cube, you can easily add the 3D cube animation into any of your React applications. \nThis tutorial was written to make you comfortable with react-3d-cube, but also to get you familiar with adjusting your code as needed.\n\n\n\nAssuming you already have a React app made, install react-3d-cube<.code>.\n\n\nnpm i react-3d-cube\n\nIf it doesn't i…",
