We created our contract for what makes a robot... that violates the Interface Segregation Principle, because not all robots can Walk, Fly or Attack.\npublic class FriendlyRobot : IRobot\n{\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n\n    public void Walk()\n    {\n        // Code\n    }\n\n    public void Fly()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"This robot can't fly!\");\n    }\n\n    public void Attack()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"This robot can't attack!\");\n    }\n}\n\nTo solve this issue, we need to break down into smaller interfaces:\npublic interface IRobot\n{\n    string Name { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic interface IWalkable\n{\n    void Walk();\n}\n\npublic interface IFlyable\n{\n    void Fly();\n}\n\npublic interface IAggressive\n{\n    void Attack();\n}\n\nNow we can create a Robot the way we want, without implementing extra code that's not necessary, so our FriendlyRobot will be implemented in a different way:\npublic class FriendlyRobot : IRobot, IWalkable\n{\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n\n    public void Walk()\n    {\n        // Code\n    }\n}",

Making new classes that inherit from the parent class, works without any change to the existing code.\nstatic void Main()\n{\n    Apple orange = new Orange();\n    Console.WriteLine(orange.GetColor());\n    // outputs: \"Orange\";\n}\n\npublic class Apple\n{\n    public string GetColor() => \"Red\";\n}\n\npublic class Orange\n{\n    public string GetColor() => \"Orange\";\n}\n\n\nLet's implement the Liskov Substitution Principle:\nstatic void Main()\n{\n    Fruit orange = new Orange();\n    Console.WriteLine(orange.GetColor());\n    // outputs: \"Orange\"\n    Fruit apple = new Apple();\n    Console.WriteLine(apple.GetColor());\n    // outputs: \"Red\"\n    Orange fruit = new Apple();\n    Console.WriteLine(fruit.GetColor());\n    // outputs: \"Red\"\n}\n\npublic abstract class Fruit\n{\n    public abstract string GetColor();\n}\n\npublic class Apple: Fruit\n{\n    public override string GetColor() => \"Red\";\n}\n\npublic class Orange: Fruit\n{\n    public override string GetColor() => \"Orange\";\n}\n\nHere, the Liskov Substitution is satisfied by our code.

          "description": "All frameworks need to keep state. Frameworks build up the state by executing the templates. Most frameworks keep this state in the JavaScript heap in the form of references and closures. What is unique about Qwik is that the state is kept in the DOM in the form of attributes. (Note that neither references nor closures are wire serializable, but DOM attributes, which are strings, are. This is key for resumability!)\nThe consequences of keeping state in the DOM have many unique benefits, including:\nDOM has HTML as its serialization format. By keeping state in the DOM in the form of string attributes, the application can be serialized into HTML at any point. The HTML can be sent over the wire and deserialized to DOM on a different client. The deserialized DOM can then be resumed.\nEach compone‚Ä¶",

Applying this to say a div element will make it stick to its parent element.
