                    <span>Last year we published one of our most popular articles on the best social media APIs for posting and scheduling. It got a lot of attention from platforms, CMS, agencies, and companies that want to programmatically post on behalf themselves or their users. For 2021, we’re updating the the list and giving more in-depth analysis so you can find the right solutions for your business.

If you want to manually post and schedule social media to networks like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, or YouTube, there are some excellent web-based posting tools out there.

Or:


npm i axios

yarn add axios

bower install axios

PUT: is a request used for creating or updating a resource in a specific server.

                    <span>** What you need ? **



Dockerhub and Github Account
Server with linux setup. For this case ubuntu
Your application is already need to be configured on your test instances
*This tutorial assumes you have set up a Jenkins file in your project. View reference make necessary changes
*sudo apt update
search of all available packages &amp; pick one from the options
For this case I will be using version 11, so 
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
Confirm installation with running version check
java -version
Now we are ready to install Jenkins. We start off by appending the Debian package repository address to the server&#x27;s sources.list
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add - sudo sh -c &#x27;echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ &gt; \


We&#x27;ll run update so that apt will use the new repo
sudo apt-get update
Installing Jenkins
sudo apt-get install jenkins&#x3D;2.289.3
That&#x27;s all 
Login into your Github, and head over to your developer settings : Profile -&gt; Settings -&gt; Developer settings -&gt; Personal access tokens
Note: I wouldn&#x27;t consider this optional but it&#x27;s good practice to set an expiration duration for your token.
Select admin:repo_hook

Lastly set repo: repo_status. Jenkins likes to access the repo commit status 
Click &quot;Generate token&quot; and save your token somewhere.
1.SSH in your Jenkins instance
sudo &quot;cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword&quot;
your-instance-ip:8080
1.Log into Jenkins
3.Set up docker hub credentials: 
4.Set up global properties in Jenkins for staging server
5.Set up Jenkins project
Under branch sources: click add source -&gt; GitHub 
Select github_key for credentials
Jenkins will scan your repo and run an initial build
In Jenkins, In the project- click “ master “ -&gt; click. “ Build now ”

                    <span>Anyone who might be following some healthy routine will definitely argue upon why the old mantra &#x27;Health is Wealth&#x27; is still gold. Ask any of them and they will make you get up(obviously, from sitting hours on end in the same position and probably not thinking about their spine) and do some stretches. 
But I will tell you one thing. It literally takes no time everyday to take care of your spine and overall health with little or no efforts. Because, you accept or not everyone suffers from back pain.
Here are my personal favorite habits that I follow to keep a check on my health.
Getting enough water everyday helps you mentally. It keeps you active throughout the day. You may feel less lethargic. Consider it as oxygen for your brain.

We use forks to eat pasta, spoons to eat soup, and chopsticks to eat dumplings. Each silverwares have its advantages/disadvantages, hence working better than the other for the food that it interacts well with. Just like that, different data structures are better suited and perform better than the others based on the situations/use cases. They each have their pros and cons. Understanding these pros and cons can help you be a better programmer, as it will allow you to choose an appropriate data structure(s) based on the circumstances/goals you have, and it helps to drastically improve the performance of the algorithm being applied. I will be putting these blog series together on well known programming data structures in JavaScript, and link them all in one blog post in the fu…</span>

Bem, hoje eu vejo que tem 3 caminhos a se seguir daqui:
Você procurar o repositório de algum projeto que você já usa e curti usar e quer contribuir;


Você pode procurar lista de projetos open-sources que muitas pessoas fazem (eu não serei essa pessoa hoje &#x3D;/);


Você pode começar a procurar por tags no github, como a good first issue.



Bem agora eu explicar cada uma delas e como elas funcionaram para mim.

                    <span>During my last post,  I told you how I was accepted into the HNGi8 internship and my plan to win the HNG trophy which is the T-shirt.
After some much wondering on the internet trying to find a helping hand on my journey on the ongoing HNG internship, I came across KODECAMP I immediately hop into their Bootcamp as it is running the same time with the HNGI8 internship, you know it&#x27;s a bonus for me as I will be learning and at same participating on the on going internship.
Why I Joined KODECAMP BootCamp.
Master my act in Frontend development.


Be able to take on any project that was thrown my way with fear. 


I have been battling impostor syndrome, by the expiration of the 16 weeks, impostor syndrome is no longer part of me. 


It will give the right focus during the ongoing internship as I will be standing on their training to tackle all the tasks thrown my way during the HNGi8 internship. 



The truth is that by the end of the internship and this current Bootcamp I&#x27;m jumping into a job as a web developer majoring mainly on the frontend stack using REACT. .

To move from the stage I currently am, I was required to make this write-up as I typically don&#x27;t like writing. But, here goes nothing.

I&#x27;m fascinated about the application of machine learning in solving real life problems and Artificial intelligence in general. My hobbies include Coding, reading, gaming, and networking.
Front-End
I am currently undergoing a web Front-End training course with KodeCamp. KodeCamp is a tech training platform that provides training tracks in web Front-End dev, Back-End dev and UI/UX designs. The training is designed to last for 12 weeks and during this time my goals are to:
Advance my html and css skills
Get hands on experience by applying my skills on real life 
projects.
Networking with industry experts and fellow tech enthusiasts.
Building up my digital portfolio.
Thank you for reading my second article, I will be posting updates on the training process.</span>
