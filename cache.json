There is a reason for the existence  of the vast amount of tools. Handling asynchronous code in a readable and manageable way has always been challenging in JavaScript. We are going to try to understand callbacks, promises, generators and async await so as to know when to use each tool and how they actually differ.\nCallbacks are the oldest and simplest way to deal with asynchronous code in JavaScript. Callbacks are also known as higher order functions. They functions passed into functions and they are executed at some point. let us have a look at an example code\nlet x = function () {\n    console.log(\"i am called from inside a function\");\n};\n\nlet y = function‚Ä¶",

          "description": "I wish the details element would support different labels (provided by the summary tag) for its open and closed states.\nConsider a label of \"Closed, click to open\" when the details element is closed and \"Open, click to close\" when open:\n\nSadly only one summary tag is supported by the details element. However you can use an empty summary with a ::before pseudo-element to implement this.\nSave the following to a file:\n<html>\n  <body>\n  <style>\n    #widget1 div { padding-inline-start: 1em; max-width: 20em;}\n    #widget1 summary::before { content: \"Closed, click to open\";}\n    #widget1[open] summary::before { content: \"Open, click to close\";}\n    #widget1[open] summary { height: 2em;}\n  </style>\n\n  <p> Text before details.</p>\n  <details id=\"widget1\">\n    <summary></summary>\n    <div>\n    A widget can be in one of two states. The default closed\n    state displays only the triangle and the label inside summary\n    (or a user agent-defined default string if no summary).\n    </div>\n  </details>\n  <p>Text after details.</p>\n  <body>\n</html>\n\nto experiment.\nNote that it might not be accessible. I didn't try to see if adding a live region aria label to the summary would cause the label change to be announced. I suspect it will not, but refining this is left as an exercise for the reader.

Getting familiar with them is not an easy task and most AWS professionals only keep up to date with them in their respective fields. For example, if you are managing containers there are currently 17 ways to run them on AWS. This means 17 different services with their own and different pricing models.\nOn June 30, 2021, Joe Nash raised the question on Twitter about what happens if a small and dedicated group of developers start tweeting about a made-up AWS product. Would it appear in job specifications within a week? He suggested the word Infinidash but was open to other suggestions.

The Predicate interface receives a parameter and returns a value boolean. The function that an interface receives is primarily some comparison that can have with returns a boolean.\nsee an example:\nList<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10);\n\n\nnumbers.stream().filter((c) -> (c % 2) == 0)\n\nIn the example above, we have a creation of a list and after that is created a filter to know what the pair numbers are.
