Microsoft is not detailing exact pricing details until the launches next month, but Windows 365 is designed for one-person businesses all the way up to enterprises with thousand of employees. \n\nlow-end\nWhile Windows 365 seems perfectly timed for businesses looking to tackle the complexities of remote work, Microsoft has been working on the service for years. the OS group at Microsoft had been working on a project codenamed \"Arcadia\", a service to stream video games from the cloud. Arcadia dates all the way back to Microsoft demonstrating Halo running on a Windows Phone in 2013. This early virtualization work eventually led to Windows 365 and a focus on making it consumer-friendly. \n\"When we built this team, we brought in a couple of leaders who had experience with virtualization, but for the most part we brought in people who had experience with Windows and experience with consumer experiences because that was the bar we wanted to set,” says Scott Manchester, director of program management for Windows 365.\nAlso because of the pandemic, the work on Windows 365 and Microsoft's broader focus on hybrid has been accelerated. Microsoft has steadily improving Microsoft Team over the past year and laying out it vision for the future of meeting, remote work, and so much more.\n\nWhile Windows 364 has the potential to dramatically change how computing takes place in commercial settings, there's nothing inevitable about it. many will object to ceding the privacy of a local box to the servers of Microsoft. Windows 365 might just be the first significant step toward a future where you don't need a dedicated Windows PC to use Windows.",

          "description": "The best way to bring value to an existing business is with the development of new applications, whether they be cloud-native applications, AI & machine learning, analytics, IoT, or any other innovative application. OpenShift, created by Red Hat, is the platform large enterprises use to deliver container-based applications. If you have read my previous posts about Docker and Kubernetes, you understand the importance of containerization in the cloud. OpenShift claims to be “the industry's most secure and comprehensive enterprise-grade container platform based on industry standards.” To put it bluntly, OpenShift is like Kubernetes on steroids.\nIn this post, I will cover a brief history of IT infrastructure, summarize the role of a DevOps engineer and why they use OpenShift, how OpenShift wor…",
