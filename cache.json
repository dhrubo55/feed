Your service that is running behind Azure Standard Load Balancer can be enabled for Private Link access so that consumers to your service can access it privately from their own VNets. Your customers can create a private endpoint inside their VNet and map it to this service.\nIn todays tutorial we will look into an interesting use case for this service, in how we can connect an external source to consume an API management service (internal VNET mode) from an external non-peered VNET.

          "description": "Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment, that allows you to write JavaScript on the server which is on of the most helpful advantages of Node.js since the same programming language can be used for server-side and client-side applications. It also runs on V8 JavaScript engine which makes it highly performant.\nAnd one of the most popular frameworks for NodeJs is our subject today in this blog: Express Express is written on top of node.js to make writing server-side javascript easier.\nSo what we are going to do today is building a very basic REST API. \nBefore we start, make sure that you have these if you don't please install them.\nNode.js installed. You can install it from¬†here\n\nAn editor that you like working in. I use VS Code, you can install it from here\n\nPostman ‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Hello coders! You've always heard the same VS Code hacks over and over again like \"install Prettier extension to format your code\", \"press alt + shift + down key to duplicate code\", etc. In this article, I'll share some VS Code hacks which I don't usually see being shared around. You owe me a like if this article helps you.\nIsn't it annoying when you've got file A opened and you want to open file B but when you click file B, file B does open but file A closes? You might double click file B to open in a new tab but does it disappoint you sometimes like it did to me? To overcome this problem, search for \"workbench.editor.enablePreview\" in your settings and uncheck the option. From now onwards, VS Code will always open files in a new tab.\n\n  \"editor.tokenColorCustomizations\": {\n    \"comments\"‚Ä¶",
