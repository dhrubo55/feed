          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it… Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.”\n— Steve Jobs\nThe common reminder, \"Memento mori\", is often interpreted as a call to withdraw our ambitions and not take pride in our achievements.\nI worry that this makes us too fatalistic, nihilistic, and self centered. \"Nothing I do matters, so why should I bother?\"\nMemento mori is no guide to life. Fortunately, I've found it has an opposite: \nMemento vivere. Remember that you must LIVE.\nThe way things are is often how we think the way things will always be. But nothing could be further from the truth:\nThe iPhone was introduced in 2007, 14 years ago.\nThe World Wide Web was invented in 1990, 31 years ago.\nThe Personal Computer revolution started in 1977,  44 years ago.\nRichard Nixon took the US off the gold standard in 1971, meaning the current international financial system is only 50 years old.\nColor TV first aired in 1951, 70 years ago.\nNuclear bombs were developed in 1945, 76 years ago.\nAutomatic washing machines rolled out in the 1930s.\nHome radios and refrigerators were first introduced in the 1920's.\nHenry Ford first sold the Model T automobile in 1908.\nThomas Edison started the Edison Electric Illuminating Company in 1882.\nAlexander Graham Bell made the first telephone call in 1876.\nWhat are we doing today that will find its place on a list like this, 100 years from now?\nI still struggle to comprehend it.\nThese events are 66 years apart. \n    \n    \n      01:10 AM - 17 May 2021",

If you’re not familiar with this sport — that’s bad — don’t worry.\nMotoGP is the premier class of motorcycle road racing. A championship is held every year and consists of many races (or Grand Prix). After each Grand Prix, each rider gains some points depending on his final position at the GP. At the end of the season, the rider with the most point wins the championship.\nThe point system in use since 1993 is the following:\n\n\nYou can find the dataset here.\nNow the cool part: coding!\nimport pandas as pd\nimport bar_chart_race as bcr\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('./2020-championship.csv')\ndf = df.set_index('race')\n\nThe final result is only one line of code away\nbcr.bar_chart_race(df=df, title='2020 MotoGP Championship Race', orientation='h', sort='desc', n_bars=10, steps_per_period=40, period_length=2000)\n\nOk, we’ve done with the coding. You can save and run the program, and you will obtain as output the bar chart race video.\nCongrats, you’ve finished. As easy as that.\n\n\n\n\nThat was just a short introduction to this library.

          "description": "In this Tutorial, I have Provided the Most Common Coding Interview Questions\n\n\nWe are all aware that answering the most basic coding or programming interview questions determines how we perform in an interview. The interview may be for Java, C++, or a JavaScript requirement, but the basis remains the same, that is how strong we are in the foundations of programming logic.\nAlso if our approach is prompt and subtle in an interview, the probability of selection is higher. So read on for cracking the coding interview questions.\nQ #1) How can you reverse a string?\nQ #2) How to get the matching characters in a string?\nQ #3) How to get the non-matching characters in a string?\nQ #4) How do you prove that the two strings are anagrams?\nQ #5) How to calculate the number of numerical digits in a string?\nQ #6) How to compute the first character of a string that is not repeated?\nQ #7) How to get the matching elements in an integer array?\nQ #8) Implement the insertion sort algorithm.\nQ #9) How to perform swapping two strings by not using a third variable?\nQ #10) Implement the process of reversing a linked list.\nQ #11) How to get the length of a linked list?\nQ #12) How to verify if a number is prime or not?\nQ #13) Compute the first five Fibonacci numbers.\nQ #14) How to reverse a number?\nQ #15) Determine the factors of a number.\nInstagram Theme Page related to programming, you can follow it if you want to :)\n\n\nIf this blog gets a good response then I will provide the answers of this questions ( who don't know that ) although you can always search the questions and get the answers yourself\nYou can also tell the topic in which you want the next blog :)\nYup another small blog though ;-;",

          "description": "This post is a few days late because I had a bit of a setback this week. My apartment lost power and internet for a couple of days, everything is fixed now but it was definitely stressful to deal with. \nGitHub\n\nGitHub\n \nGitHub\n\nGitHub\nThis exercise was all about Object and Arrays and making a reference vs. a copy and how they can be manipulated. If you make a reference to an array and update that array it will edit the original array as well because it is an array reference and not an array copy. So they both are pointing to the same array. To fix this a copy needs to be made instead. There are a few techniques to do this. You could .slice() to make a copy of an array. You can also create a new array and concat the old one or even use the ES6 spread operator. When those new copies of arrays are created and updated, the original one is not changed. This also applies to objects.",

          "description": "Introduction\n\n\nMost of us have come across terms like multithreading, parallel processing, multiprocessing, concurrency, etc., though each of these terms has its own meaning. In a broader sense, we need these because we want to avoid some kind of latency (or have an illusion of doing so) in the execution of regular programs.\nTo do this, we try to write code that doesn’t necessarily runs in order (non-sequential) and all this boils down to two different concepts — concurrency and parallelism.\nI came across concurrency when I was trying to download ~5000 images from the web. I had collected image URLs from Flickr, and these images had to be passed on to a team doing annotation (labelling).\nThis is how a sequential program to download images would look like:\nimport requests\n\ndef download_imag…",
