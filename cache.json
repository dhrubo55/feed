          "description": "It's Friday, it's nearly my Birthday, it's time to address some long running iterative projects (projects I never finish) LRIP for short 🪦. \nI have a bunch of these projects which I may one day finish.\nThe kernel 🐣🍗 is the entry point of an application (aka your computer) which a Filesystem sits on top of, the kernel provides syscalls to do things like change directories, write files and so on, these syscalls are usually C functions (that's it, no magic, although FYI Rust 🦀 is entering the chat).\nOkay so we got functions, an application and how do we use this application?\nHow do you use your computer without a GUI? That's a trick, don't answer that because terminal is graphical, kind of... But yes a terminal, but the shell, that's what we are talking about.\nThink of the most basic shell... Shell not Bash, just Shell, it's just a parser really, type 'cd' and the shell parses your input, cd is not in your bin it's a syscall cd(), cool right? 😴, Wake up ☺️\nGet to the point, what do I need a Filesystem written bin JavaScript for, it sounds useless. Precisely, this filesystem offers nothing more than the bear bones 🐻 to represent a Filesystem, it's going to have a lot of extension points (plug-in a function) allowing library authors to represent a Filesystem as a data structure. \nA web server / application with a limited and synced to phisical disk \nSome sort of mock FS testing\nDeploy a yeoman style template in node.js\nBuild an OS real or otherwise\nBuild the next docker 😅\nBrowser mock FS\nWasm FS thing\nhybrid synchronized FS\nsome new build system concept\nPort it to Rust\nMake it work on a real disk (it's possible with Fuse) \n\n\n\n\nSo I'm on my phone, I can't go explaining the code because it's not done yet, BUT it's intuitive I feel, also it's locked down as much as possible so that only a new Shell() can actually interact with the FS just like the real thing.\nSuch a fun toy, want to help me, get in touch we can FOSS it 🦄",

You still need to pay attention to a few points if you want to get the best out of it, especially from a SEO point of view.\n\nStatic websites made with Gatsby, NextJS or Hugo have everything to boost your SEO score and help you get the golden 100 mark on Lighthouse. \nIndeed, expect to see your speed performances soar, with insanely low FCP (First Contentful Paint) , LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) and CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) values.\n\nHowever, a great Lighthouse score does not necessarily mean a better ranking and visibility on search engines.
