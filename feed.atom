before starting, I want to remention that the BalanceFactor BalanceFactor = height(left sub-tree) - height(right sub-tree) should be -1, 0 or 1.
We use this rotation when the tree is a left unbalanced tree like this example below:
     15 (bf:2) 
    /
  11 (bf:1)      left unbalanced tree
 /
9 (bf:0)

in this case, the tree needs a right rotation (RR), so the unbalanced node(15) becomes a right child of its left child (11)
           11  (bf:0)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the newly released Manual Validation task you can pause a YAML pipeline mid-stage. This allows you to perform manual or offline activities and then resume (or reject) the run. 
As I've mentioned, you can use this new task in a YAML pipeline to pause a run within a stage, typically to perform some manual actions or validations, and then resume/reject the run.
This is especially useful in scenarios where you want to pause a pipeline and validate configuration settings, build package, etc. before moving on to a long-running, compute-intensive job.
When the Manual validation task is activated during a pipeline, it displays a message bar containing a link that opens the Manual validation dialog containing the instructions. After carrying out the manual steps, the administrator or user can choose to resume the run or reject it.
Let's see this in action. We will cover how to configure Azure Pipelines to use it and how to use it.
Here you have the video with the whole demo and explanation.




Link to the video: https://youtu.be/sfb3d100JPo
Remember that, as I've mentioned in the video, you can use this new approach only in an agentless job of a YAML pipeline. If like in my example you have other jobs already, you would need to add a job with pool: server to make this work.
I wanna know what you think about this feature, so let me know in the comment section below.
Also, check this video over here, where I talk about the differences between Classic and YAML pipelines for both Build and Release.

The degree is the number of edges that are connected to a vertex, for example, the vertex A has a degree of 1 and the vertex C has a degree of 2.
Graphs can be either directed or undirected, directed graphs are like a one-way street, undirected is like a two-way street.

Graphs can also have cycles.

Graphs might be a disconnected one, that means it consists of isolated subgraphs, or a connected one, in which all every pair of nodes are connected by an edge.

Graphs can be used to represent networks, websites structure, also used in path optimization algorithms, there are applications in other fields, such as linguistics, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, etc.

Well as the documentation states, An intent is an abstract description of an operation to be performed. This simply means that anytime you hear or read the word intent you should automatically think to yourself, ok, some sort of work is about to be done. An intent can also be thought of as the glue between activities, as it is often used to share information.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that uses documents for data storage. MongoDB is considered schema-less, which means that it doesn't require a defined database schema. It's a great tool if you want to scale and evolve quickly, as it supports rapid iterative development and allows multiple team members to collaborate.    
Docker is a tool that you can use to build applications that run on your host operating system. It runs natively on Linux. Docker uses containers and allows you to combine your application with all its dependencies into a single unit. With Docker, it's easy to create a container and start working with different technologies. 
In this tutorial, we'll create a MongoDB container using Docker.

Here's an example:




let arr = ["Playstation", "Rules"];
let str = arr.join(" ");

str would have a value of the string Playstation Rules.


Let's use the join method (among others) inside the sentensify function to make a sentence from the words in the string str. The function should return a string. For example, I-like-Star-Wars would be converted to I like Star Wars.




function sentensify(str) {

  // Only change code above this line
}

Answer:

}
console.log(sentensify("May-the-force-be-with-you")); will return May the force be with you

I had to understand what offline-first apps really meant. I found different definitions of it around the internet. Partial offline functionality, partial offline data etc. but I wasn't satisfied with any of those, so I settled with the following definition:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The split method splits a string into an array of strings. It takes an argument for the delimiter, which can be a character to use to break up the string or a regular expression. For example, if the delimiter is a space, you get an array of words, and if the delimiter is an empty string, you get an array of each character in the string.


Here are two examples that split one string by spaces, then another by digits using a regular expression:




let str = "Hello World";
let byWords = str.split(" ");

let otherString = "How9are7you2today";
let byDigits = otherString.split(/\d/);

// byWords would have the value ["Hello", "World"]
// byDigits would have the value ["How", "are", "you", "today"]

Now let's use the split method inside the splitify function to split str into an array of words. The function should return the array. Note that the words are not always separated by spaces, and the array should not contain punctuation.




function splitify(str) {
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
}
splitify("Hello World,I-am code");

If you remember from my other posts simply split the string to create a new array of words. A simple regular expression can be used to achieve this result.
/\W/ Matches any non-word character. This includes spaces and punctuation, but not underscores. It‚Äôs equivalent to /[^A-Za-z0-9_]/


Answer:




function splitify(str) {
let splitWords = str.split(/\W/)
return splitWords

}
console.log(splitify("Hello World,I-am code"));
