I&#x27;ve been there. Twice, actually. About 6 months ago, I started looking into AI but got too intimidated. I talked myself out of it.
Not this time! And I&#x27;m here to help you not get overwhelmed at where to start. There&#x27;s a lot of information out there, and it can be difficult to know where to start.

                    <span>Hi, this is #day_6, we&#x27;re going to talk about Binary Search Algorithm.
binary search also called half-interval search, or logarithmic search is one of the most famous search algorithms, 
this algorithm search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

The space complexity of linear search is O(1) and his Time complexity is O(log n).

                    <span>What are &quot;Callbacks&quot;?


A callback function is usually used as a parameter to another function.
The function that receives callback function is normally fetching data from a database, making an API request, downloading a file, which usually takes a while.
Assume getting some data from the API and the request takes around 2 seconds to complete. 

Now, you can either wait for the API call to complete and then display your UI,
OR, you show everything else and show a loader where the API data needs to be shown.
In the API function, we pass some sort of &quot;call back&quot; function that replaces loader with actual data, so once the response is received from API
It calls the callback function with the data and, then our callback function replaces the loader.
Let&#x27;s see this in action:

                    <span>Tarefas agendadas são uma ótima maneira de executar processos repetitivos de maneira automatizada em nossos projetos, basta definir as tarefas e escolher os momentos em que elas serão executadas e pronto, pode deixar o resto do trabalho com o cron do servidor.
Geralmente essa definição dos momentos em que as tarefas irão rodar fica dentro do projeto e acaba sendo suficiente em muitos casos, porém, essa maneira de gerenciamento acaba sendo um empecílio quando se precisa alterar o horário em que as tarefas serão executadas. Gerenciando dessa maneira, será necessário uma alteração no arquivo, e uma nova release do projeto para as alterações terem efeito. Isso também restringe que o ajuste no horário da tarefa seja feito somente por um desenvolvedor.

                    <span>D3.js is a JavaScript library that enables you to create dynamic data visualizations in web browsers. It specializes in visualizing large data sets in an understandable and interactive way. The D3.js library stands out as one of the best data visualization tools for front-end developers because of its core features, such as DOM manipulation, dynamic properties, and animations.
Today, we’re going to show you how to build your first bar chart using D3.js. Let’s get started!
We’ll cover:
Project overview
Initial setup
Create your dataset
Set dimensions and margins
Append SVG element
Gather and format data
Add bars
Next steps

Today, we’re going to build a bar chart using D3.js. This is a great project because it allows you to practice your D3.js data visualization skills in a practical way.

After my last post on 5 Steps to Plan a Side Project, I started to search for new project ideas. While there are tons of lists of them online, I just cannot be satisfied with them for some reason (maybe because I just want to be creative and contribute to a unique project instead of tutorial projects). 
I just found a new idea while eating lunch with my father the other day. 
ps. it is related to food 😌
So, I was wondering...
How do y&#x27;all find side projects to work on? Where does the initial idea come from?</span>

ERC20 token and BEP20 are almost identical, so you will be able to use code snippet used here for that also.
We will use SCAM token as an example of BEP20 token.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>

Finer resolutions usually translate into lower energy usage and lower heat production. Given that many of our systems are limited by heat or power, finer resolutions lead to higher performance.

I wish to compute efficiently the number of matching characters (same position, same character). E.g., the strings ‘012c’ and ‘021c’ have two matching characters (‘0’ and ‘c’). The conventional approach in C would look as follow: uint64_t standard_matching_bytes(char * c1, char … Continue reading Counting the number of matching characters in two ASCII strings</span>
