                    <span>This is one of the strange problems of VirtualBox which drives me crazy until I figured out, how simple the solution was.
If you are running from the same problem, don&#x27;t worry. Just make sure you are using the right installer for your distribution/OS
By the way, Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: libc6 (&gt;&#x3D;2.28) or libc6 (&gt;&#x3D;2.29) is referred to as the same problem
OK, Let me explain a bit further,  A few months ago I was wanted to install VirtualBox on my Linux Mint computer, So, I went to the VirtualBox Official website (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads) but I won&#x27;t found the installer for Linux Mint Version ( It&#x27;s still not present here as you can see in the picture below)

So, I downloaded  Ubuntu 19.10 / 20.04 / 20.10 / 21.04 version because I knew Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu. so, whatever works on Ubuntu should be work on Linux Mint as well. It was not a big deal. But it just won&#x27;t worked and threw this Dependency is not satisfiable: libc6 (&gt;&#x3D;2.28) error.

At that moment I reconsider my OS. I was using Linux Mint 19.3 Cinnamon. OS version placed a critical role here. I simply Googled &quot;Linux Mint 19.3 Ubuntu Version&quot;  and found Mint 19.3 is based on Ubuntu 18.04 . 
I revisit the download page and download it again but now from the  Ubuntu 18.04 / 18.10 / 19.04  option and run the installer and Guess what, It was running absolutely fine without any issue. Through the installer required some extra dependency, not an issue, just allowed it

Maybe you downloaded the Debian 10 version installer, not working.. then download it for Debian 9. Fedora 33/34 not working... download it for Fedora 32. Just make sure that the VirtualBox installer is compatible with your OS version :)

For this tutorial you need some background of Node.js and have docker installed on your machine 
In computer science there’s the concept of queues. Queue is the set of messages that are meant to be delivered from one sender to one or more receivers. The messages can be delivered in order or out of order by design. The computer program that handles these transactions is called message broker. RabbitMQ is one the most popular message brokers that runs on top of Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). There are four main components forming AMQP protocol: Publisher, Exchange, Queue, Consumer.
Messages are Published to an exchange by a publisher, Publisher also is responsible for setting the attributes of the message which we will cover later.

Once I started implementing an authentication system, I found myself coming back to these terms again and again to separate their individual roles and purpose in the system. This article was created to serve as a quick reference.
process of the Principal proving its identity to the System


Examples of Principal


application
computer system
human
hardware, etc
System is any computer system that requires identification before allowing access
System could be hosted on


server
device
browser, etc
characteristic of an authentication mechanism


that relates to
the user&#x27;s identity being used to


provide access across multiple Service Providers
allows a single authentication system to be used across multiple systems
The single authentication mechanism could be


LDAP or such directory server
a system generating trusted token
Federation (see below)
the management of identity concerns within an information technology organization
can include 


authentication of users and system
authorization of those users and systems
user provisioning
audit of identity systems
user repository management (like LDAP or Active Directory)
password policies and other concerns
common standards and protocols


to manage and map user identities
between Identity Providers


across org (and sec domains)
via trust rel (like dig sig, enc, PKI)
a sub-discipline of IAM, but typically the same team(s) is involved in supporting it
a type of SSO where the actors span multiple organizations and security domains

                    <span>Last week I faced one problem in the HTML text area. it more about the user interaction with the text area component. In, this article I am going to cover the problem and solution.
We all know about HTML input element and behaviour. but, In the input have one problem is inside the text box large text not able to read properly. 
Example:

In this case in our mind comes This problem will solve replace Input element to Text area element. so, we able to read the text properly.
Yes. but, inside the text area will come small text. so the text area will fill more space without having large content.
Example:

Use text area with increase height based on the content. now, solved the problem in both cases.

                    <span>Hello coders!! Today we will discuss some concepts you need to know to build real complex applications with React and Redux.
In this article we&#x27;ll cover the following concepts in detail:
Why we need redux?
What is Redux?
Steps to create a React-redux application

Step 1: Create a User Component
Step 2: Create a Store
Step 3: Create a Reducer
Step 4: Share Redux Store with Components
Step 5: Add an Async Function Middleware using Redux Thunk
Step 6: Build an Action Creator
Step 7: Connect redux store to components
Let&#x27;s get started!! 🚀🚀
Before we jump to more details of Redux first try to understand why we actually need it?
In a complex application with many components, if you want to share a state among the several components, then one approach you can think of is using props.

But props…</span>

  Intro 


Continuing on from my previous blog about website security week, we&#x27;re going to talk about a validation.
If accept user input, you are going to need to validate the input. Non validated user inputs can lead to security vulnerabilities for example SQL injection attacks, where user input escapes your database and starts modifying it. It can also lead to exceptions from your code if a user inputs text rather than a number for example.
Please Please Please ensure you do the same validation server side as you do on the frontend (client) side.



You user inputs should be contained in HTML forms which comes with lots of powerful validation tools built in.
First thing to check on your inputs is, are you using the correc…</span>

I will also share a few resources that can be useful for full-stack developers when creating this project. The idea itself is not limited to web development, but I will be discussing it from the perspective of full-stack web developers.
Password managers are not a new idea by any means, and managing passwords is not an unsolved problem. 
There is a large number of solutions out there, so you will not be in lack of resources for inspiration. The large number of solutions, however, should not discourage you from implementing one yourself.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
