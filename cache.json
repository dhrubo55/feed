What‚Äôs been holding me back so far is the sheer abundance of options - I feel like a little kid at the candy store. Torn somewhere between frantically running around and completely paralysed. \nDuring the bootcamp I participated in, we created our own web app with React, Node & MongoDB and tested a little with Cypress. Deployment / Hosting was not part of the course. Now while these are probably solid options, these choices were made for me. Now I am wondering, if I am completely free to choose, how do I decide on the stack for a project? \nI get that this highly depends on the project‚Äôs requirements and personal preferences. But say I want to create a very basic portfolio page - think virtual business card, really nothing fancy as an MVP (else I will literally never even try this). \nI discussed this with colleagues and got pretty diverse (and sometimes confusing) answers. This these perspectives helped me a lot put my own research into perspective, I would love to hear from you: \nHow would you choose what to work with?\nBased on what you would like to learn or rather something you already know well? \nHow do you determine what tech stack is best suited for what you want to do?\nDo you rather try something new and shiny or do you have a ‚Äòwinning team‚Äô you aren‚Äôt likely to change any time soon?\nLiterally any tip, opinion or resource is highly appreciated :) Thanks so much!",

This module offers many useful higher order functions that act on or return other functions, which we can leverage to implement function caching, overloading, creating decorators and in general to make our code a bit more functional, so let's take a tour of it and see all the things it has to offer...\nLet's start off with the simplest yet quite powerful functions of functools module. These are caching functions (and also decorators) - lru_cache, cache and cached_property.

I honestly think you need to look at react-query if you fall into any of this category.\nServer state is state that's actually stored on the server then is temporarily store in the client for quick-access (like user data, transaction data)\nReact's lack of standard data-fetching paradigm has led to the creation of several state management libraries. However, these libraries do not fully support handling async data(server state) properly. Async data is typically handled at the component level where each state associated to it is usually tracked i.e loading, error, data, refreshing e.t.c. as the number of server states tracked increases, th‚Ä¶",
