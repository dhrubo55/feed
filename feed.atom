As it is true for you to learn everything as a full-stack web developer, you also need to be familiar with a lot of tools that will make your job easier and faster.
Full-Stack web development covers both front-end and back-end web development. So this article spans across front-end and back-end web development tools.
For each of the tools I outline, I will not fail to tell you what specific part of web development that tool belongs to.
VSCode
GitHub
Postman
Chrome DevTools

VSCode - Text Editor



VSCode (Visual Studio Code) is a text editor that is used to write and manage code. A text editor falls into both a front-end and back-end tool.

Vale lembrar que Elixir é uma linguagem de programação funcional, portanto, não é o nosso forte o conceito de objeto, classe e métodos. No final, sempre estaremos falando sobre módulos e funções!
Então de que me serve possuir uma abstração para criar interfaces em uma tecnologia como esta?
Imaginem que vamos desenvolver uma aplicação onde a pessoa insere seus dados para consultar todos seus cartões de crédito, verificar se as faturas estão em dia, e inclusive gerar possíveis estratégias financeiras, etc...
Para isso precisamos criar uma API REST que irá consultar de diversas fontes de cartões para validar os dados e processar as respostas finais.

While exploring different backend infrastructure options at Streamlux, we decided it would be best to add our own containers to the Appwrite Traefik network. This way we could host completely custom web servers on the same machine as Appwrite. Allowing for extremely low latency between the server and Appwrite, and allowing us to have 100% flexibility in terms of API.
If you haven't heard of Appwrite, taken from Appwrite.io:
Appwrite is a self-hosted solution that provides developers with a set of easy-to-use and integrate REST APIs to manage their core backend needs.
From one developer to another, check it out, it's awesome!

'?PerPage=100' is the first parameter that is passed with this URL. It’s up to your javascript logic to grab this parameter’s value and use it appropriately. So can there be multiple parameters? You betcha! Additional parameters are added with the following syntax:

What is a good response?
1. Do not invite the client to the meeting


Well, the most obvious first step is not to invite the client to the meeting. If the client is important to define the task, then have clarifying meetings with the client.
The process of estimating the tickets is an internal developer affair. Only the developers know the codebase and can make any good estimations of how long a task will take.

When your overall project is composed of multiple projects, it is tempting to create one Git repository per project. In Node.js, a project translates to a package. However, managing too many closely related repositories is confusing and time-consuming.
Placing multiple projects inside a single Git repository and using a tool like Lerna to facilitate their management worth the effort. This architecture is called a monorepo. It simplifies the versioning and publishing of the components as well as their manipulation and development.
At Adaltas, we have been developing and maintaining several monorepos for a couple of years. This article is the first one from a serie of five in which we share our best practices. It covers the projec…]]></summary>

I’ve enjoyed playing around with this library for the last couple of days, but recently, I found myself in an unpleasant situation. All my Redux logic, including asynchronous calls to APIs, was packed down into one slice file (more about slices in a bit). 
Albeit this being the way RTK suggests we structure our slices, the file starts to become hard to navigate as the application grows and eventually becomes an eyesore to look at.

Part 3 (this one) - what is Reactive Programming all about?
The name React is already declaring that it is used in reactive programming, but what is that? Wikipedia is defining it as "a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change". It expands on that to say that it declares the relationship between elements and updates them when either change. You can easily imagine a graph of elements magically updating as any of them changes. However, the implementation details of that magic matter.

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
