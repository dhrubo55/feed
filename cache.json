          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

Neste tutorial vamos ver um pouco mais sobre algumas abordagens de como podemos fazer uma comunicação entre nossos componentes.\nSim, já que todo componente que criamos se trata de um elemento HTML customizado, nós podemos ouvir e disparar eventos como qualquer outro elemento faz, além de adicionar eventos customizados também. Eventos serão a forma mais comum que terá para fazer a comunicação entre os elementos.\nCaso você não sabia nós podemos disparar os eventos do HTML de forma programática, sem a necessidade de interações do usuário.\nconst clickEvent = new Event('click')\n\ndocument.querySelector('button').dispatchEvent(clickEvent)\n\nCom esse simples código você verá que o evento atrelado ao…",

This has the effect of adding a reliability layer atop unreliable Activities and Workers, in a durable and scalable fashion. However, understanding the terminology can be a bit intimidating at first glance. \nThis post (together with the embedded talk) aims to give you a solid mental model on what each Activity timeout does and when to use it.\nNote: You can also set Workflow timeouts and retry policies you can set. This post deals only with Activity timeouts.\nYou can watch this 18 minute talk where our CEO Maxim Fateev explains the 4 Types of Activity timeouts you see in Temporal.\n\n\n\n\nThe rest of this post summarizes the main points covered in this whiteboar…",

One of the first decisions you have to make is whether to join a startup or a bigger, more established company. Here’s a quick case for startups:\nThe earlier you are joining the company, the higher the financial benefits can be. If the startup does well, your share options can be worth a lot of money. The people you’re going to work with are often very entrepreneurial and innovative (and since you’re reading this article, you probably are too). You can learn a lot being around other creators, sharing ideas, and discussing things openly. It’s a stark contrast to more corporate processes and environments.\nIt’s not all paperwork and sitting in meetings. At a startup “agile” is a…",
