          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

These resources can be anything, from images to stylesheets, fonts, scripts, iframes etc.\nWe're going to use the package called, \"Lozad.\" To lazy-load images. Lozad. will only add 1 KB to your production 📦! Check out Bundlephobia  😱 for more info.\nWe're only going to lazy-load images but Lozad can handle lazy-loading for srcsets, background images, videos and iframes too. So, let's include the package and start hacking! 🪓\nnpm i lozad\n\nInclude Lozad in your entry or main JavaScript file. Alternatively, you could use Lozad CDN if you don't have module bundler set up.\nimport lozad from 'lozad';\n\n// Make sure to run the library only when all DOM elements are available.\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {\n   /**\n   * This is all you need to do!\n   * Check the link for advanced usages.\n   * https://www.npmjs.com/package/lozad\n   */\n   lozad().observe();\n});\n\nBy default, Lozad will look for images with class, \"lozad,\" and the attribute of \"data-src\". When the image is about to enter the viewport, Lozad takes the data-src attribute and assigns it to to the src attribute to load the image.\n<img class=\"lozad\" data-src=\"https://example.com/img.jpg\" />\n\nThat's it, you've successfully added support for lazy-loading 🎉🧨🎊!\nBest practice would be to leave the images that are in the header and lazy-load only the ones that are below the initial viewport.\nUse Lozad to lazy-load a background image and video!\nPlease, share your thoughts and experiences as to how lazy-loading improved your website.

They are not mutually exclusive, but they are not exactly the same idea. That's why I did not say \"Ux vs. intuitiveness\". While intuitiveness is essential, it should not be the ultimate goal at all costs.\nLet's take a concrete example. A member of my family bought a brand new car recently.

I really like the interactions that it creates between team members and working together on a certain task. Having experienced a team where pair programming was not a thing and a team where it was, I can definitely say that there are a lot of benefits to pair programming and it can greatly contribute towards a team. In this article, I will go over what pair programming can do for your team and why your team should also adopt it.\nNo two developers are alike.
