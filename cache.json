          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

So I decided to explore the React code to understand how it works.\nSpoiler alert: I will simplify a lot the process made by React to make the article easier to read and that you don't quit it before the end :D.\nBefore going deep in the React codebase, I would like to explain what was in my head about the management of event listeners.\nFor example when I write this simple code:\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n     <button onClick={() => console.log('Click on the button')}>\n        Click me…",

These new tags like <details> & <summary> bring about new ways for browsers to identify new elements on a webpage and with more description.   \nThe need for more descriptive tags were necessary as the internet grew and here's a few important reasons for Semantic HTML: \nAccessibility: Tags like <nav> & <article> give more meaningful information for things like screen readers, which allow upwards of 5 million more people with reading disabilities to access web pages. \n\n\nAdvanced Capabilities: Tags like <audio> & <video> bring new ways to add media to web pages. \n\n\nSpecificity: Tags like <header> & <footer> provide more clearer distinction than divs for developers to work with. \nex: <div id=\"header\">Semantic HTML</div>\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Converting to Semantic HTML\n\n\nLet's make this more accessible to get rid of the deeply nested div issue.\n\n<!-- Before -->\n\n<div id=\"header\">\n <div id=\"section\">\n   HTML Elements:\n\n   <div id=\"article\">This is an article about HTML elements</div>\n </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<!-- After -->\n\n<header>\n <section>HTML Elements:</section>\n\n <article>This is an article about HTML elements</article>\n</header>\n\nModernizer - Javascript library for detecting Semantic tags on a website.\n\n\nVisit MDN for a deeper look into Semantic HTML elements.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Let's chat about Semantic HTML\n\n\nThe was a quick intro into Semantic HTML and how you can make your web pages more descriptive and accessible.
