          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

While some companies lock down their APIs to only provide very limited information, DEV.to goes the extra mile to provide an extremely robust API. Let’s go over what is available!\n\n\n\n\nLink to Project: https://www.josephamaurer.com/Projects/DevAPI/RecentDevPosts.html \nLink to DEV API Documentation: https://docs.forem.com/api/ \nDEV’s API allows for lots of interesting functionality. In the video above, I go over a use case where you pull the latest 100 posts, and create bootstrap cards for each. In each card I display three buttons. The first is either active or disabled if the user has a twitter account. This is useful because I like to retweet articles and tag their creators. The second button is a link to the DEV post. Finally the third button opens the API response for the article.\nWhile my example showed articles, there are lots of different things that the API can return to you. One of the more interesting functionality is the ability to post an article completely from the API. I have no idea why you would want to do that, but it could be useful. \nAll in all, it’s cool to think that this functionality exists, even if you can’t find a practical use case for it. One of the more useful use cases might just be populating your recent articles from your blog to your website. \nLet me know what you would want to do with this API!",

          "description": "Web push notifications are a way of informing your app users when something important has happened. \nUsers can receive web push notifications even when they are not actively using your application, for instance, if the app is open in a background tab or even if it's not open. \n\nPush notifications are widely supported by all browsers except for Safari: 78% of web users use a browser that supports them.\nIn this tutorial, I'll show you how to subscribe to notifications in the browser and how to send notifications from a Java server. \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  A bit of background: how web push notifications work\n\n\nWeb push notifications rely on two web standards: Notification API and Push API (which in turn uses ServiceWorker). They require HTTPS to work. \nThe server shares its public key with the browser\n…",

          "description": "When building Microservices the de facto way to do it is to use both HTTP, as the protocol, and REST, as the way to represent resources. HTTP is literally the foundation of the World Wide Web and it is supported by multiple programmings in one way or another, so using HTTP is a no brainer because it could be used by any Frontend and Backend code with few to no external dependencies.\nREST is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer coined by Roy Fielding and introduced in his doctoral dissertation, it is an architectural style that defines guidelines when building web services, it's not a standard but it does use standards like HTTP (and its verbs to represent actions) and payload/message formats (like JSON or XML), to mention a few.\nThis is the first of a series of posts covering ste…",
