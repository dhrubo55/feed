                    <span>Over the last four months, I have recorded what is probably the most interactive JavaScript course that has ever been created.

However, very few courses seem to take these pitfalls seriously enough. So this course is meant for anyone who has experienced any of the above issues when learning JavaScript.

While looking for a more suitable solution, I came across the Broadcast Channel API.
It allows communication between different documents (in different windows, tabs, frames or iframes) of the same origin. Messages are broadcasted via a message event fired at all BroadcastChannel objects listening to the channel.

                    <span>My first draft of this post focused on all of the good that followed IE6 in the world of web development but I think it‚Äôs worth focusing on why we&#x27;re so happy to be saying goodbye to my nemesis for a lot of the last 20 years. Later this year support for Internet Explorer officially comes to an end and in mid-2022 it will be retired completely.
From 3-pixel bugs, to different implementations and interpretations of the CSS specs, the end of internet explorer couldn‚Äôt come soon enough. Never heard of the 3-pixel bug? If you have access to IE 11, then go here and use emulation to pretend you&#x27;re in IE5 (IE6 is not available for some reason) and you&#x27;ll see a three pixel indent of the first paragraph in the green box. Maddening.
I had the misfortune to not only have to support IE6 in my development career, but also IE5.5 and even Internet Explorer for Mac too. Internet Explorer for Mac. Truly trying times.
Microsoft eventually moved onto Internet Explorer 7 but the improvements were minimal. IEs 8, 9, and 10 were not much better and even now 11 is painfully slow. Over the past 5 years, I&#x27;ve lost count of how many times I have been asked to look into performance issues and it turns out it&#x27;s the browser itself struggling. The code itself is good enough for everyone else, the user&#x27;s hardware rarely an issue and the APIs themselves performant. Every other browser coped without any issues.
Edge is a clear improvement on the browser experience for Windows users and long overdue. Built on top of Chromium, the dev tools are there and so are all of the performance benefits that come with things like the V8 JavaScript engine.
Goodbye, Internet Explorer. You will not be missed.</span>

In today&#x27;s video, we&#x27;ll take a look at .NET Hot Reload which shipped in the latest Visual Studio 2019 preview. In short, you can modify your apps source code while the application is running, without the need to manually pause or hit a breakpoint. Just make a change and click the &quot;apply code changes&quot; button and the magic happens.
Note: I&#x27;m not on this team at MS. I&#x27;m just a dude playing around with new bits like everyone else.

                    <span>There are many great use-cases to read and write data to a local file.
Today I&#x27;ll be exploring the basics of reading and writing data to a file in Python.
The first part of file interaction would be to read data from an existing file.
Let&#x27;s create a basic txt file called text.txt at the root of our project.
Hi there

How cool of you to try and read me
Hope you have fun

To read this file in Python, we can use the open() function built into Python.
After opening the file, we can use the file.read() function to see what&#x27;s in it.
file &#x3D; open(&#x27;test.txt&#x27;, &#x27;r&#x27;)
print(file.read())

This will print the exact content of our file.
Now that we know how to read a file let&#x27;s see how we can write data to that same file.
There are two options when we open a file for writing.
a: Append data to the existing file
w: Write, this option will overwrite any existing content
Let&#x27;s first try the append option:
file &#x3D; open(&#x27;test.txt&#x27;, &#x27;a&#x27;)
file.write(&quot;I&#x27;m an extra line of content&quot;)
file.close()

If we now check our file, it shows:
Hi there

How cool of you to try and read me
Hope you have fun
I&#x27;m an extra line of content

Now let&#x27;s use the write function and see what happens.
file &#x3D; open(&#x27;test.txt&#x27;, &#x27;w&#x27;)
file.write(&quot;I have new content now&quot;)
file.close()

Checking the file now shows us:
I have new content now

As you can see, the old content is gone now.

                    <span>TL;DR: Bad booleans do a bad job modelling state. Good booleans are derived from well-modelled state.
When you&#x27;re managing state in your app, it&#x27;s easy to fall prey to bad booleans. Bad booleans look like this:
let isLoading &#x3D; true;
let isComplete &#x3D; false;
let hasErrored &#x3D; false;

On the surface, this looks like good code. It appears as though you&#x27;ve represented three separate states with proper boolean names. In the &#x27;model&#x27; you&#x27;ve pictured for your state, only one of these states can be true at any one time.
In a fetch request, you might model the state like this:
const makeFetch &#x3D; async () &#x3D;&gt; {
  isLoading &#x3D; true;
  try {
    await fetch(&#x27;/users&#x27;);

    isComplete &#x3D; true;
  } catch (e) {
    hasErrored &#x3D; true;
  }
  isLoading &#x3D; false;
};

                    <span>Ever wondered what a black hole looks like? My AWS Billing‚Äîor yours‚Äîmight be one of the closest things to a black hole on earth. So scary, and so hard to remove things from it, firstly because we don‚Äôt know what services to remove nor the regions for those unwanted services.
Let‚Äôs focus on how to remove things from the AWS bill, which is the main task that will definitively cleanse our bill. It‚Äôs so easy to spin up new services in AWS and forget about them, some might be cheap some others might not be that cheap; and given that AWS‚Äîat the time of this writing‚Äîprovides over 175 services in several regions each, it becomes quite a task to manage all of your services in all of the regions you used.
Enter the Bills page. Go to your Billing Dashboard, and then on the left sidebar, under the Billing section, click on Bills. Below AWS Service Charges you can see all of the services you have signed up for, and inside each of them, you can see the incurred costs per region. This way you just need to figure out what services are not in use, then go to their regions and remove them.

This way I was able to spot an unused RDS instance and a very old Amplify instance, both burning money with no returns.</span>

Interns selected for the program work on their project for 3 months under the guidance of mentors and are paid a stipend of $6000.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
