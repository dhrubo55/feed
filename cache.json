The answer is not too obvious.\nEstimating the cost of a new product is fundamentally difficult, and people are not very good at predicting events accurately. No project repeats another, each is unique not only in its goals, but also in the countless features that shape it. Often a problem that is simple at first glance turns out to be much more complicated from the inside, and sometimes it requires serious technical improvements to solve it. And, undoubtedly, in any project there are always many unknowns that arise already in the process of working on it.\n\nIn addition, there are no identical people - no customers, no developers, no users.
