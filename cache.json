          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

Although they are related, they mean different things, confusing if the basic idea is not well understood.\nTo define it, authentication answers the question, 'Who are you?' while authorization answers the question; 'What are you allowed to do?'.\nAuthentication can be defined as the process of verifying that the user is whom they say they are.\nSome common examples of authentication are \npassword authentication\nbiometric authentication\nmulti-factor authentication \nAuthorization is the process of allowing users to perform specific actions based on the permission(s) they have. An example is a role-based authorization. Allowing different users to perform specific actions based on their roles; user or admin.\nWe can try to understand these concepts better with this scenario.\nBefore you board a plane, you have to show a means of identification along with your boarding pass to show that you are whom you say you are; this is authentication. The flight attendant verifies the details you give them, and then if it matches, you are allowed to board.\nSo this explains the difference between authentication and authorization.",

Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries.

But what if your design is more interesting the other way around? What if you'd like a page to start at the bottom and scroll up?  In this blog you'll learn how to implement reverse scrolling on your website in just 3 steps...\n1.Start with just 7 lines of HTML:\n<div class=\"panelCon\">\n   <div id=\"pane-5\" class=\"panel\">Section 5</div>\n   <div id=\"pane-4\" class=\"panel\">Section 4</div>\n   <div id=\"pane-3\" class=\"panel\">Section 3</div>\n   <div id=\"pane-2\" class=\"panel\">Section 2</div>\n   <div id=\"pane-1\" class=\"panel\">Section 1</div>\n</div>\n\n2.Few lines of CSS:\nbody {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  height: 500vh;\n}\n.panelCon {\n  position: fixed;\n  bottom: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  width: 100%;\n  z-index: 99990;\n}\n.panel {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100vh;\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n  font-size: 30px;\n  line-height: 35px;\n  text-transform: uppercase;\n}\n#pane-1 {\n  background-color: pink;\n}\n#pane-2 {\n  background-color: #e8e8e8;\n}\n#pane-3 {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n#pane-4 {\n  background-color: pink;\n}\n#pane-5 {\n  background-color: yellow;\n}\n\n3.Finally, just 3 lines of JS:\n$(window).on(\"scroll\", function () {\n  $(\".panelCon\").css(\"bottom\", $(window).scrollTop() * -1);\n});\n\nAnd you're done.\nDon't want to follow the steps?
