        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm Aya Bouchiha, in this beautiful day, I'm going to explain the Heap data structure.
Heap: is a complete binary tree (types of a binary tree)  (which each node has at most two children and All the leaves should lean towards the left) where the root node is compared with its children and arrange accordingly.


The key of every node is smaller than or equal its parent 
 
arr[parent] >= arr[i]

The key of every node is greater  than or equal its parent 

arr[parent] <= arr[i]

Heap sort algorithm
Order statistics Getting The minimum value or the maximum value in a constant time
Graph algorithms like Prim's Algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm
Priority Queue
The space complexity of the heap is O(n)



insertion (push)
deletion (pop)
peek




O(log n)
O(log n)
O(1)

Along the years, as civilizations started to grow, many systems of counting (Or numeral systems) were created, such as:
Tally marks

Binary is a numeral system based o two digits (0 and 1), which represents numbers based with a base of 2. It's used to write binary code which is the "language" to communicate instructions to a computer processor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is the end of Module 2/5 on my SWE bootcamp at Flatiron School and it is time to build our own apps with React. The time has come to chose a topic and start building something from scratch.
Excited and terrified
Up until this point all the exercises I had worked on came with the basic design already built in and it was just a matter on knowing how to pass props from one component to another, or how to update the State. Once I was asked to build everything from scratch I felt completely lost.
With no time to loose I decided to build and app related to something I'm passionate about, something I enjoy doing on my own. Is then when it hit me. Camera Equipment!! Huge surprise...
I have a lot of camera equipment that I some times buy and sell in order to buy other camera related things. Why not building something that could help me keep track of my purchases?
Once I decided the topic it was time to start building it, but first, I wanted to plan out the entire app on a piece of paper. No surprises this time. No more build-as-you-go.

From ideation to execution
Ok. I had the idea and I knew what the app would do. I also had a roadmap of how it should look like (kinda...), now I only had to figure out how to make it work.

The incredible power of React
At this point I have been working on Your Camera Gear for two weeks and I am still polishing code and fixing some bugs here and there, but the bulk of the application was made really really quickly. I'd say I was able to put together a semi good looking website within the first two days of working on it. It was already fetching info from my database and displaying it nicely on my homepage, and it had several components built in into the home page and there were a couple of events triggering when clicking in my items.
Not only that, some of the components I had built were very easy to recycle and create new components off of the existing code. It is just a matter of which props they are receiving. Simply amazing.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before Knowing about Code Splitting we need to know Why we need Code Splitting these first we need to know about bundling. Bundling is a process that takes multiple files and merges them into a single file, which is called a bundle. Most React apps will have their files ‚Äúbundled‚Äù using tools like Webpack, Rollup, or Browser. Let's see an example:
App:
import { add } from './math.js'; 

// math.js

export function add(a, b) {

  return a + b;
}


console.log(add(2, 4)); // 6

Bundle:
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}


console.log(add(2,4)); // 6

As our app grows, our bundle will grow, especially when using large third-party libraries. If the bundle size gets large, it takes a long time to load on a webpage. Resolving these issues Code splitting comes into the scenario.

Node.js is an open-source Javascript run-time. It is used to create server-side APIs, network applications and services. It was designed to build out highly scalable applications with high concurrency.
Node has made it very easy for frontend developers to create full-stack projects by using prior Javascript experience on the server side. This has been great for teams to re-use codebases and increase productivity.  
Node is built on the V8 chrome javascript engine that has yielded amazing performance. The asynchronous non-blocking design makes for a blazing fast experience dealing with lots of concurrent operations. 
Node.js makes it really easy to produce real-time applications such a real-time chats by allowing synchronized  connections via websockets and reliable client/server communication.
The event driven architecture of Node.js is pattern on observing event behavior with event listeners and responding to events predictively. These is perfect for client-side web applications make use of many meaningful interactions on the interface and providing a great user experience. 
Node is supported by the entire Javascript community and has lots of great open-source tooling and NPM packages that make developing with Node a breeze. Node is quickly being adopting in tech stacks of lots of companies and producing great results in performance.

It is not a big deal when we have to make just one or two API calls per requests. But most of the time we have to make two or more API calls depending on the requests. That's when problem occurs. Because the more API calls you make, the longer it will need to serve the data.
Let's assume you have to handle a request which requires five API calls. You make five API calls one by one. When all of the data is available, you clean, format and merge them and send it to the frontend. Let's say it takes six seconds to get data from all of the API calls. Six seconds may seem feasible but it's always better to make things efficient and faster whenever possible.

so let's start, we need to download one python module named "pywhatkit".
STEP 1: installation of module pywhatkit.

STEP 2: Now after you have successfully installed this module in your system then you have to import it into your code.

STEP 3: Now it's time to use the method text_to_handwriting().

an important point to remember: you have to use a double forward slash or backward slash(\\ or //) according to your device while defining the path as you can see in the above picture.
And now you can check your directory which you passed as an argument in the method, you will get your file there.

Hope this post has helped you.
