I love a bit of architecture. How you structure your application is so important and if you get it wrong you&#x27;ll really pay for it down the line. The problem is you often don&#x27;t know you&#x27;ve got it wrong until it&#x27;s too late. I&#x27;ve made this mistake so many times and iterated on solutions so much that now when I start a project I know exactly how I want it to be structured. I&#x27;ve developed what I consider to be a pretty robust pattern for application development.
Essentially I follow a loose Hexago…</span>

A friend of mine reach out and asked me whether I could write a program to detect the number of Rubber stamps in an image. Apparently, these invoice receipts will be categorized based on the number of stamps on them. Initially, I thought of building a Deep Learning Segmentation model, but soon I realized that it is not worth the effort. 
The images are generated in a controlled environment so few computer vision algorithms should do the trick. To illustrate the computer vision algorithms used i…</span>

                    <span>The most common way for frontend programs to communicate with servers is through the HTTP protocol. If you&#x27;re used to vanilla JavaScript, then you&#x27;re probably familiar with the fetch() API which allows you to fetch resources and make HTTP requests.

Almost every new application starts out its life under very simple circumstances.

However, the number of users starts to grow, traffic spikes, transactions increase across the system, and user needs might prompt the requirement of mobile, d…</span>
