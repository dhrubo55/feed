One should depend upon abstractions and their concrete implementation.
The advantage of Dependency Inversion is that the classes do not need to know about the concrete implementation, just its abstraction.
public class UserFileRepository

public class UserService

    public void CreateUser(User user)
    {

The code above is totally fine, but it does not respect the Dependency Inversion Principle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states:
A client should not implement interfaces that are not necessary for the application.
In other words, it's preferably that instead of one big interface, the developer creates smaller more manageable interfaces.
Let's say we're tasked to create a game about robots, at first, we design our interface:
public interface IRobot
{
    string Name { get; set; }
    void Walk();
    void Fly();
    void Attack();
}

Perfect! We created our contract for what makes a robot... that violates the Interface Segregation Principle, because not all robots can Walk, Fly or Attack.
public class FriendlyRobot : IRobot
{
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public void Walk()
    {
        // Code
    }

    public void Fly()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This robot can't fly!");
    }

    public void Attack()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This robot can't attack!");
    }
}

To solve this issue, we need to break down into smaller interfaces:
public interface IRobot
{
    string Name { get; set; }
}

public interface IWalkable
{
    void Walk();
}

public interface IFlyable
{
    void Fly();
}

public interface IAggressive
{
    void Attack();
}

Now we can create a Robot the way we want, without implementing extra code that's not necessary, so our FriendlyRobot will be implemented in a different way:
public class FriendlyRobot : IRobot, IWalkable
{
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public void Walk()
    {
        // Code
    }
}]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Created by created by Barbara Liskov and Jeannette Wing, the Liskov Substitution Principle or (LSP for short) states that:
You should be able to use any derived class instead of a parent class and have it behave in the same manner without modification
In other words, each derived class must maintain the behaviour from the parent class along new behaviour unique to the child class. Making new classes that inherit from the parent class, works without any change to the existing code.
static void Main()
{
    Apple orange = new Orange();
    Console.WriteLine(orange.GetColor());
    // outputs: "Orange";
}

public class Apple
{
    public string GetColor() => "Red";
}

public class Orange
{
    public string GetColor() => "Orange";
}


Let's implement the Liskov Substitution Principle:
static void Main()
{
    Fruit orange = new Orange();
    Console.WriteLine(orange.GetColor());
    // outputs: "Orange"
    Fruit apple = new Apple();
    Console.WriteLine(apple.GetColor());
    // outputs: "Red"
    Orange fruit = new Apple();
    Console.WriteLine(fruit.GetColor());
    // outputs: "Red"
}

public abstract class Fruit
{
    public abstract string GetColor();
}

public class Apple: Fruit
{
    public override string GetColor() => "Red";
}

public class Orange: Fruit
{
    public override string GetColor() => "Orange";
}

Here, the Liskov Substitution is satisfied by our code. The application don't need to change to support a new Fruit, since the subtype (Apple and Orange) that inherit from the type Fruit, can be replaced with each other without raising errors.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Single Responsibility Principle (or SRP for short), states that:
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
This doesn't mean that a class should contain only one method or one property, but its members must relate to its responsibility.
For this example, we're going to create an UserService, its responsibility, is to manage User data in a system.
public class UserService
{
  public void CreateUser(string email, string password)
  {
    if(string.isNullOrEmpty(email)
     throw new NullArgumentException("E-mail cannot be null or empty.");

    if(string.IsNullOrEmpty(password)
     throw new NullArgumentException("Password cannot be null or empty.");

    User user = new User(email, password);

    var smtpClient = new SmtpClient("smtp.gmail.com")
    {
        Port = 587,
        Credentials = new NetworkCredential("email", "password"),
        EnableSsl = true,
    };

    smtpClient.Send("our.app@gmail.com", email, "Welcome!", "Welcome to our system!");
  }
}

The example above violates the SRP principle because the CreateUsermethod is responsible for two things, creating an user and sending an e-mail.
Let's change it so it respects the SRP principle.
public class UserService
{
  private readonly IEmailService _emailService;

  public UserService(IEmailService emailService)
  {
    _emailService = emailService;
  }

  public void CreateUser(string email, string password)
  {
    if(string.isNullOrEmpty(email)
     throw new NullArgumentException("E-mail cannot be null or empty.");

    if(string.IsNullOrEmpty(password)
     throw new NullArgumentException("Password cannot be null or empty.");

    User user = new User(email, password);

    _emailService.SendEmail(email, "Welcome!", "welcome to our system!");
  }
}

Now the UserService is only responsible to create the user, and it delegates the e-mail to another class.]]></summary>

<mark> is a tag used to highlight or mark a part of a text. This tag supports all HTML global attributes, the default color is black with a yellow background color.

Most frameworks keep this state in the JavaScript heap in the form of references and closures. What is unique about Qwik is that the state is kept in the DOM in the form of attributes. (Note that neither references nor closures are wire serializable, but DOM attributes, which are strings, are. This is key for resumability!)
The consequences of keeping state in the DOM have many unique benefits, including:
DOM has HTML as its serialization format. By keeping state in the DOM in the form of string attributes, the application can be serialized into HTML at any point. The HTML can be sent over the wire and deserialized to DOM on a different client. The deserialized DOM can then be resumed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you click on a link, but instead of arriving to the site you want, an error message appears, stating that the page you requested is unavailable. It should be something along the lines of '404 Not Found.'
When website content is deleted or relocated to another URL, an error 404 message is commonly shown.
The 404 status code is the most common HTTP status code.
A server answer to a browser's request is an HTTP status code. When you visit a website, your browser makes a request to the server, which the server responds to with a three-digit code called the HTTP status code.
These status codes represent a communication between your browser and the server over the Internet. They convey if things are fine😊, touch-and-go👍, or if something is wrong😕 between them.

Each three-digit status code starts with one of five integers, ranging from 1 to 5, and is written as 1xx or 5xx to signify status codes in that range. For example, 200, 301, 404, 500, and so on...
100–199 - Informational responses: The server is thinking through the request.
200–299  - Successful responses: The request was successfully completed and the server gave the browser the expected response.
300–399  - Redirection: You got redirected somewhere else.
400–499  - Client errors: Page not found. The site or page couldn’t be reached. 
500–599  - Server errors:  A valid request was made by the client but the server failed to complete the request.

HTTP Status Code 200 - OK
HTTP Status Code 301 - Permanent Redirect
HTTP Status Code 500 - Internal Server Error
HTTP 404 errors can decreases a website’s ranking and reputation.
