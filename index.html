Question: 
We have a 9 line function that goes three indentations deep.
We can simplify this function. The question is, how much more readable are we able to make this function?
Through six simple iterations of refactoring this function we are going to simplify this hasUSNumber function into a single line with zero indents.
1: Traditional if-else statement (with nested if)
let hasUSNumber &#x3D; dude &#x3D;&gt; {
   if (dude.phone.exists &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; true) {
      if (dude.phone.number.startsWith(&#x27;+1&#x27;)) {
        return true
      }
   } else {
        return false
   }    
}


2: Inverse if-else condition to remove nested if

                    <span>Hi, on this amazing day! we&#x27;re going to talk about tree data structure, so let&#x27;s get started!
A tree is a nonlinear data structure unlike Stack, Queue, Array, and Linked List, It is a collection of nodes connected with edges
Root: parent node is the first (top) node of the tree.
Parent: node has children
Child: node has a parent 
Siblings: nodes have the same parent
Leaves: last nodes of the tree
Depth: length of edges from a node to the root
Height: length of the longest path from a node to a leaf
Edge: link two nodes

                    <span>Low code and no code have all the hype, but among developers, they also have equal amounts of skepticism.
In March 2021, no code pioneer Zapier acquired no-code community Makerpad. In April 2021, UiPath, a provider of low code automation software, IPO&#x27;d at $31 billion. Gartner predicts that by 2024, more than 65% of application development activity will come from low code application development platforms.
Software is eating the world, but low code and no code are making developers rethink how software is made.
Of course, (some) developers tell a different story. According to an Evans Data report, one in five developers never use low code, and almost three-quarters of developers use low code less than half the time. And anecdotally, many developers express a similar sentiment to low code a…</span>

Create
Track
Revert
Update
Publish
View
Branch
Conflict
Below i have given classification of git mechanism along with their important commands.
When it comes to files
git init          
git add .
git add [filename]

When it comes to a repository
git clone ~/folder_A ~/folder_B
git clone git://url
git clone ssh://url

Track is when we want to track our files for commit, update or delete operations.
git add files // adds files ready to be commited
git mv prev_place target_place //moves files
git rm files //removes files from working directory but adds it to the staging index
git rm --cached files //stops tracking but keeps files in working directory

We use revert when we want to do a new

To create a PWA (progressive web app) you need to use a webmanifest. The first thing you need to do is create a file called manifest.json and include this snippet inside the head of index.html.


Since manifest.json has many required properties to get your PWA working. I&#x27;ll explain every one in-depth and how to implement them

short_name is what the user sees on their home screen. 
name and description is what the user sees when installing the PWA

When a user installs your PWA, it uses an array of icons to display on the home screen. Each icon is an object in which you need to specify the type, src…</span>

When you’re working on a static site and GitHub Pages feels like the perfect hosting solution, since you like having everything in one place and then you realize you need an additional environment but you still don’t want to use anything but GitHub… Here’s what you can do.



This is a “special needs” article but also a general introduction to GitHub Actions.
Since the advent of Single Page Applications the requirements for hosting have been reduced to a minimum. Anything that can serve a static HTML file will do the job just fine and the browser, bombarded with Javascript, does the heavy lifting. High availability and security is a totally different topic of course but in this case I believe GitHub has you covered.

                    <span>As a junior developer making my first ReactJS project I heard the horror stories of writing poor code when using Google Maps Javascript API, and wanted a free resource for rendering maps. I wanted to be sure I would not get a random bill for thousands of dollars from Google, so if you&#x27;re trying to create a React app and want to have a free mapping service, look no further than React-Leaflet! It&#x27;s an easy way to display a map in a React Component and render it with whatever information you want to use from your Redux state. This post will give you step by step instruction on implementing React-Leaflet. These instructions assume you are comfortable with Javascript, React, and Redux concepts and also assumes you have set up your application through

The Metasploit framework is a very powerful tool which can be used by cybercriminals as well as ethical hackers to probe systematic vulnerabilities on networks and servers. Because it’s an open-source framework, it can be easily customized and used with most operating systems.
With Metasploit, the pen testing team can use ready-made or custom code and introduce it into a network to probe for weak spots. As another flavour of threat hunting, once flaws are identified and documented, the information can be used to address systemic weaknesses and prioritize solutions.

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
