        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, today, I'm gonna discuss the famous types of graphs, before reading this post, I suggest you check this post (introduction to graph in data structure) firstly.
Directed Graph : (also called directed network or digraph) in this type, every edge is directed from one node to another. 

Undirected Graph: all the edges can be traversed from both directions.

Weighted Graph: in this one, all edges have a weight which is a numerical value

Unweighted Graph: the opposite of weighted graph, each edge has not a weight


Connected Graph: a connected graph is a graph that has a path between every pair of nodes.




Disconnected Graph: a graph is called disconnect if there is at least two nodes of the graph are not connected by a path. 

Simple Graph: a graph is simple if it has no loops and no multiple edges.

What is an f-string?

Why f-strings

Padding / truncating

Rounding numbers
Converting types
Adding commas to large numbers

Nested formatting
Custom formatting using __format__

"f-strings" are a feature added to Python in version 3.6, and it's essentially a new, more concise way to embed values inside strings.

I am currently a Masters's candidate studying computer science at Colorado State University. After I completed my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Philosophy, I was employed as a cybersecurity intern by the academic computing and networking services at CSU. I quickly developed a deep passion for cybersecurity and computer science and decide to go back to school to learn more.
While studying for my master's, I have been employed as a Junior Systems Administrator for the Computer Science department, managing over 600 Unix machines. This summer I am also working for Hedera Hashgraph as a developer advocate intern providing educational content on how to leverage the Hashgraph distributed network.

So I mostly took them for granted and used them to make my code more concise. But, inspired by my friend’s nerd rage, I decided to learn more about why people do and don’t like arrow functions.
Arrow functions are a hotly debated topic in the JavaScrip community. Some people think you should use them almost exclusively, and others think you should never use them at all!

React provides a very good and simple way to manage local states through state hooks but when it comes to global states the options available are overwhelming.
React itself provides the context API which many third party libraries for managing global state are built on top of it, but still the APIs built are not as simple and intuitive as state hooks, let alone the cons of using the context API to manage global state which we won't be discussing in this post, but there are plenty of articles talking about it.
So managing global states in react is still a problem with no clear solution yet.
But what if I tell you there might be a solution which is based on global variables?
Yes the global variables that you use every day in your code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys 👋, here's another side project I worked on in June. Hope you enjoy it.
So I made a decision earlier this year to at least create a project monthly on something I really like as a means to improve my skills, work on my creative side and have some fun, this is part of the June entry(s). Charity hunter was created as part of a 24hr hack hosted by sigma hacks from Jun 25 – 26, 2021, I thought of backdating this but it felt less genuine 🤷‍♂️ , so here it is, a couple days late:
Live / Repo  





  
  
  Inspiration 💭


I wanted to make something to enable people to easily find trusted charities and provide aid to their different causes, so I came up with Charity hunter, it uses your location to find charities near you, also, lets you find specific themes/causes you want to support all from a vetted database of charities provided by GlobalGiving. It was a simple idea but I believe it can be very useful.
React & plain CSS
Global Giving API
Firebase Hosting
Google Maps API
The notion task list used ⬇ *



The Initial UI design ⬇ *





  
  
  What's Next ⏭



Mobile Responsiveness; since the goal is ease, this is first on the list.
UI improvement; the UI needs a bit of work to make it more intuitive and crisp.
Search Filter; filter by more categories and toggles.
Code Refactoring; some areas of code need to be adjusted to make contributing to this easier and to follow standard code principles.
Any other feedback or feature request is alright.
I believe this is something worth working on, and it's something that could help a ton of people. More ideas, more features, better UI / UX and more reach which can only be done when we all come together, the more contributors the better. So why don't you jump in and put some hands in the pot

I hope you enjoyed this and maybe gained something from this short post. Looking forward to the next one.]]></summary>

Prisma is one of the best database libraries I've ever used. In a nutshell, you write a schema, and Prisma can apply the changes to your database, and generate a Typescript client library custom-tailored to your databases.
For this example, I'll use a simple blog app. It has a User table, and an Article table. Users can have many Articles, and each Article only has one author.
To install Prisma, run yarn add prisma -D.
In a folder called prisma at the root of your project, you can create a file called schema.prisma. This is where the descriptions (or "schemas") of your tables will be stored.
Prisma uses this file to apply changes to the database, and generate a custom client for us.

You can ignore the migrations folder for now.

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<replace_with_channel_id>
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
