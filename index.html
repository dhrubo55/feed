                    <span>What are Web Components?


Web component is a term used for four web standards that help us make custom, reusable and encapsulated html tags that can be used in web pages and applications.
1.  elements: With the  elements, we encapsulate html, and then render it using javascript.
So what happens is that template elements break apart html. Whatever is contained inside the template tag doesn&#x27;t get rendered at load-time. Instead javascript renders when the function is called. So a page would load very quickly, since we have part of html that doesn&#x27;t load at load-time. We can also reuse these elements, so we save a lot of time.

2. Custom elements: With custom elements, we create a javascript class, and then link it to a custom html element.

[P.S : Refer the codepen given below to see visually how each property behaves]
Consider that you have a list of paragraphs and you want to show it in 3 or 4 columns and also decide where or how the content can break. Let&#x27;s see the first step on how you can split the content in a simple way.
Create a div with multiple paragraph tags or a ul with multiple li tags
Add the below code snippet
columns: 3 //  should be a positive integer. Here the paragraph will be split into 3 columns.
.split-3-columns {
  display: block;
  columns: 3; // value based on how many columns you want the content to split
  height: 250px; // height of the div as per your need
}

If you know but don&#x27;t care—that would be the worst. You lucky buddy, you are in the right article. Here are the 7 coding habits you might have and if you have them,   drop it right now.

Instead of learning different languages, one should focus on mastering one language.

Knowing everything is okay. But it doesn’t mean that you won’t make any mistakes. When you are dealing with a big project, it may possible that there is a little syntax error. Being overconfident on what you know will lead you to make little mistakes.

While working in team projects, asking help from your team members will help you in interacting with them. You will able to know the abilities of your team members.
In this article, @Ayodele Samuel Adebayo shows you 10 reasons why you should ask questions! 




So here are the 7 bad(worst) habits you should drop right now. Happy Coding!

                    <span>Balancing some code to be readable yet workable.
Today I was coding and decided to refactor some older code. In particular, this code is handling navigation updates in a Fable Elmish app in F#.
let routeToPage routeOpt &#x3D;
    match routeOpt with
    | None -&gt;
        let page, effects &#x3D; OpsUser.Search.init None
        OpsUserSearch page, effects
    | Some route -&gt;
        match route with
        | ToOpsUserSearch searchOpt -&gt;
            let page, effects &#x3D; OpsUser.Search.init searchOpt
            OpsUserSearch page, effects
        | ToOpsUserAdd -&gt;
            let page, effects &#x3D; OpsUser.Add.init ()
            OpsUserAdd page, effects

This function has many route cases but only two are shown here.

                    <span>This is my 1st write up on dev.to site. Source code included as link. I use VueJS, but you can use vanilla JS too.
PWA app needs manifest.json to be installable. We usually have index.html with the link to the manifest.json file, the separate one, where all items are defined. This file is static, the only way to change it is to edit it&#x27;s source code (as you are developer, NOT user). Suppose we serve static files, not dynamically created by node.js or similar server side technology.
Today I will show you a practical example how to change some manifest&#x27;s items dynamically on client side, i.e. as user.
I need to say my work is not my invention, it is based on excellent work, ideas and researches of other developers.

This is a finance tool project based heavily on beancount but with less features and way less complexity. After reviewing the beancount repo and documentation, I noticed that there are many more features available that I will use. In an attempt to create a new project with a new language, C#, this project was born.
This is a console application. As of right now the only major dependency is the System.CommandLine package. The commands code is written in namespace Controllers.Commands and the parsing and formatting of entries is written in namespace Controllers.VaultAccess.
Here is an example of one of my commands.

                    <span>With JavaScript, some operations are asynchronous, and many of these asynchronous operations are signalled via promises.
For instance, fetching data from an API is an asynchronous operation; you need to wait until data from the API has been fully downloaded. So, invoking fetch doesn&#x27;t give you the data. Instead, it gives you a promise, from which you will need to have another function be called to receive said value, as the first parameter of that function.
With a promise, to get the result the instance that is available, you invoke the then method, and pass in said function as the first parameter.
Here&#x27;s an example:
const fetchPromise &#x3D; fetch(&#x27;http://example.com/some-api/&#x27;);


fetchPromise.then(response &#x3D;&gt; {

Starting as a software developer, it&#x27;s recommended to follow a more pragmatic approach to developing software.
As time goes on, when you start building more complex software that serves thousands or millions of users, it becomes crucial to be more concerned with concepts such as architecture, system design, testing, security, deployment, and most especially performance. Furthermore, on performance, it is common practice to follow key performance metrics such as average response time, traffic rate, and CPU usage of your application and the server.
The main issue now stems from acquiring the best profiler tool that measures your Node.js application performance based on these metrics and doesn’t affect the software responsiveness.

N.B., CPU profiling and CPU …</span>

According to the research I did, most of the articles I read had solutions that used a lot of hooks, some use a lot of regular expressions, and some use a mixture of both.
However in today&#x27;s example I&#x27;m just going to use the hooks we are all familiar with (useEffect() and useState()). And another little thing that in a few seconds I&#x27;ll explain.
So we&#x27;re going to create two super popular components, Route and Link. The Route will be in charge of registering our route and rendering its component. The Link will be used to navigate between …</span>
