        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!, my name is Aya Bouchiha, on this beautiful day, I'm going to share with you 5 useful string methods in Python.
Firstly, we need to know that all python methods do not change the original value of the string, they return new values.
startswith(prefix, start = 0, end = len(str) - 1): checks if a string starts with a giving value.
prefix: to check that the string starts


start = 0: the starting index where the giving prefix is needed to be checked.


end = len(str) - 1: the ending index where the giving needs to be checked.



more details...
phone_number = '+212123456789';
print(phone_number.startswith('34',1)) # False
print(phone_number.startswith('+212')) # True
print(phone_number.startswith('56', 8)) # True
print(phone_number.startswith('78', 10, 12)) # True

As frontend developers we are constantly adding and releasing new features or fixing bugs as per business requirements, and it's hard to keep vigilance on the security side of things. It has become a secondary concern and we are far behind the backend and Devops engineers for whom this is a primary and regular part of their thinking in development process. Today security attacks are on the rise and we need to take measures from both server side and client side before its too late.

Basic Data Structure in JavaScript: Arrays includes how to access an array in JS.
Before starting that, we need to know two very important things.
1)JavaScript arrays are zero-based indexed. In other words, the first element of an array starts at index 0, the second element starts at index 1, and so on.
2) How to Get an Array Size. 
So, let's start with that.
Typically, all arrays have a length property which returns the number of elements or in other words, size of an array. 
Let's see an example of an simple one-dimensional array and get it's size.
let petsArr = ['cats','dogs','cows','fishes','birds'];
console.log(petsArr.length);

//output: 5

The output shows 5 as it has five elements occupying five indices from 0 to 4. So the size of this array is 5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For this post, we're going to explore a way to stream data to the client using a Web Api and C#.
Picture this requirement, you need to process an array of data, lets say of a 100 items, once each item is processed, the api should return to the client, without TCP/IP and SignalR, just pure HttpRequest.
To do this, in this example, we will have an worker that will return a IAsyncEnumerable and between each iteration, the method will wait between 5 to 10 seconds.
//Service.cs
private static readonly Random _random = new Random();

public async IAsyncEnumerable<int> GetData(int amount)
{
    foreach(var item in Enumerable.Range(0, amount))
    {
        // Wait a random amount of time to simulate some work.
        var secondsToWait = _random.Next(5,10);
        await Task.Delay(Timespan.FromSeconds(secondsToWait));
        yield return item;
    }
}

With the simulated service in place, we can move on to the Controller. For the endpoint, we're going to have an async Task Get method that will write the result to the Response and send it for every item it was processed.
// StreamController.cs
private readonly IService _service;

public StreamController(IService service)
{
    _service = service;
}

[HttpGet("{amount:int:min(1)}")]
public async Task GetStreamData(int amount)
{
    // Set Content-Type to text/event-stream
    Response.Headers.Add("Content-Type", "text/event-stream");

    await foreach(var data in _service.GetData(amount))
    {
        // this can be anything, even just a json object
        string dataItem = $"data: {data}\n\n";

        // Convert the text to a byte array
        var utf8DataitemBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(dataItem);

        // Write the byte array to the HttpResponse
        await Response.Body.WriteAsync(utf8DataitemBytes, 0, utf8DataitemBytes.Length);
        // Push
        await Response.Body.FlushAsync();
    }
}

When the endpoint is called, it'll send a new "line" of data instead of waiting for all items to be processed to be sent at once.]]></summary>

Fastify is an alternative of Express (L express) which you must have heard of if you are familiar with NodeJS before. In fact, Fastify draws its inspiration from Express only that Fastify servers are way faster compared to Express servers.
I have tested it, and I can testify of its speed. I am currently building a Mobile Application, and in this app, I use Fastify for my API.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The internet is made up of over 1.7 Billion web pages with different page layouts. Technology  nowadays is responsive to any screen orientation or dimension of the screen in our devices. Making page layout comes in handy with the use of Cascading Style Sheet also refers to as CSS. CSS is one of the cornerstones of the web. More like the flesh covering the bones of the body. It is easy to understand and there are lots of resources available on how to use this amazing piece of technology.
So how is this related to our topic? 
CSS is use to design layout and the appearance of those web pages but creating multi-layouts is a huddle for beginners who intend to create project with that feature. 

CSS Grid: This is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. Like tables, grid layout allow us to align elements into columns and rows.
display:grid, set the column and row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, and then place its child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row.


Flexbox: The CSS Flexbox offers a one-dimensional layout. It is helpful in allocating and aligning the space among items in a container (made of grids). It works with all kinds of display devices and screen sizes.
display: flex;




What is the line of divide between these two?
