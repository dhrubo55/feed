                    <span>Disclaimer: In this article I list the key points I consider every time I do a code review. This is not a step by step guide on how to do code reviews. I don&#x27;t expect everyone to agree with the statements below. Finally, English is not my first language, so my apologies for any mistakes.
Code reviews is the time of judgment (this meant to be a joke) - it&#x27;s the place where you give the opportunity to other developers to validate the piece of code you proudly worked on. Regardless you are a junior or senior developer, there will always be something you might have missed in your code, or could be written in a better way.
There are times where code reviews turn to be a battlefield between the reviewer and the code author though. But this should not be the case. Remember, the result of a code r…</span>

                    <span>Let&#x27;s talk about accessibility overlays.
I&#x27;m referring to automated codes that are supposed to &quot;handle&quot; the accessibility part. Many of those tools miss most accessibility errors that jeopardize the use of assistive technology.
For example, some projects use toolbars or javaScript plugins to make the website more accessible without changing the source code.
There are many overlays out there. Some are generic, and others focus on specific impairments, such as cognitive disabilities or visual diseases.
For example, if you have dyslexia, specific fonts and magnifiers are supposed to improve your experience by applying a different letter spacing.
This way, websites may pass some tests that follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

I managed to try some new mechanics and hazards, like deadly blocks and changing layouts of the map with one button and also screen wrap. I think to remove jumps and use better the level&#x27;s gimmicks. I tried even stuff like bouncing, dashing and reducing to zero the gravity but that doesn&#x27;t work for now.

                    <span>I was fortunate to have a mentor guiding me and pointing out the pitfalls while learning to code. At that time, I was tempted to believe that I could learn to code in 3 months and become proficient. However, the truth is learning a programming language is similar to learning any human language, such that you have to start by learning the ABC (alphabets), syntax, and logic.
Most beginners usually believe that learning to code is a piece of cake. They glance through it and assume that is the best method.
Deliberate practice and often guided by an expert skilled coach or mentor (someone with an expert eye), according to bestselling author Daniel Golemon, these coaches and mentors are offering feedback in specific ways to improve and without such feedback, you don’t get to the top ranks.

Chosing what will compose a stack is both a matter of experience, opinion and timing.
Experience helps identifying what will stick, but opinion has a major role in the final chosing.
As of timing, what seems to be a good idea at the time, may be compromised by a lack of maintainers goodwill or vision a year later.
So by no means is the LOLstack The Perfect Stack™️. Now that&#x27;s out, let&#x27;s cover what it has to offer.
TL;DR: Enough with the stalling, Access the good stuff
An App, an API, a Database and all of the in-between that make an App and its stack work.

So this 🤪 crazy app idea has been growing in your head lately. Yet nothing has been done about it, as you don&#x27;t see clearly how nor when building it.
Business and Market reasons aside, the most common reasons (/cough excuses) not starting working on your crazy idea Minimum Viable Product (MVP) are in my opinion:
🧍‍♀️ Being alone
Ok you don&#x27;t have a team yet, but suck it on.
⌛ Takes too much time
Sure. Creating something new and different takes time. But what if? is took less than expected?
😫 Technology fatigue
Behind hypes, technology cycles and experts contradictory opinions, there can be some technology fatigue, which will tickle beginners to tech veterans.
what if the fatigue were no more?
🤯 Cognitive complexity
It&#x27;s actually sane to think that there is a lot of area to cover for an app to work, and that a lot of knowledge in multiple areas are needed. On top of the actual app development, there is also the question of the database, of the APIs, of the security, authentication, production debugging, etc.
what if this cognitive complexity were already tackled by others?
Are you thinking of a 5th reason? Please drop your suggestions in the comments 💬



What if all these reasons were no more? (Well... Apart being alone, you&#x27;re on your own mate)
As lots of us have been tickering, playing and working with lots of technology bits, some of us have converged all this know-how into ready-to-use stacks, that help bootstrapping your next projects.
At codename, we have been developing our take of what a stack should be.
Featuring LOLstack, your ready-to-dev &amp; ready-to-deploy software stack.

                    <span>OK, the tragedy was like this.
Everyone knows how convenient the javascript Array fill() is to let users initialize array data elegantly. Perfect invention.
// create an array of length 6 with all elements equal to 0.
let arr &#x3D; Array(6).fill(0)

It is even extremely useful if for creating a range of integers for iteration or some other fancy operations.
// you must fill the array or there won&#x27;t be keys
Object.keys(Array(6).fill(0)).map((i) &#x3D;&gt; dosomething(i));

Recently I was fascinated by these kinds of functional programming styles and mistakenly assumed that is was similar to Python collections.defaultdict() which lets you pass a primitive or an object as a factory so that it will automatically new an independent value for each entry in the array.
Unfortunately, it is not the case.

                    <span>CSS offers a nifty property called image-rendering which lets you influence how images scale. Normally, when you take a small image and make it bigger, the image becomes blurry. That&#x27;s kinda ok for photos, but for pixelart, the effect is... rather devastating.

  What is pixelart?
  Pixelart is a way of creating pictures. Rather than using brush strokes, each individual pixel is carefully colored. It&#x27;s like if you were given just a few hundred square tiles and asked to make a mosaic out of them. 



However, thanks to image-rendering, it&#x27;s possible to upscale images in a way that highlights their pixelated nature! Just a couple lines of code later and...
.pixelart {

Clean code does one thing, 
does it well, and does it only.
    





  
@cleancodestudio

      
 Less code is less buggy.
Less code is less onboarding.
Less code is less maintenance.
Less Code &#x3D; Less Liability.
Clean Code is minimalistic.
    





  
@cleancodestudio

      
Ex: Use verbs to name functions.
