I wanted a place to dump my thoughts and different things I try, and learn in the process. \nI recently upgraded to a new laptop (HP Omen 15-en0037AX). The laptop has a four-zone RGB LED backlight on the keyboard. Like most laptops that ship with such a keyboard, the manufacturer shipped a preinstalled app (Omen Light Studio) on windows to customize the various lighting modes on the keyboard. \n\nHP Omen Light Studio\n  \nUnfortunately, this app is only available for Windows, which is a problem, as I am primarily a Linux user.\nSince I have always been interested in cybersecurity and have taken part in multiple CTF (Capture the Flag) events, I have a basic understanding of how to Reverse Engineer C/C++ binaries using tools like Ghidra but have never reversed an actual real-life application. In this series I want to (hopefully) achieve two things:\nReverse Engineer the Omen Light Studio App, and figure out how it interfaces with the hardware on the laptop to control the keyboard's lighting.\nRe implementing the functionality on Linux (maybe in C/C++/Python/NodeJS) and possibly make a similar desktop app.\nThis series is going to be me documenting all my approaches (right or wrong), and also explaining various concepts I learned in the process.

For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.
