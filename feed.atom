        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s talk about the business owners who want to build an app as an extension of their current brand, business, or website.

What’s your budget?
Does this sound too high to you?
Your location is relevant to how much it’s going to cost to develop your app.
If you’re located in North America, expect to pay roughly $150 per hour if you’re planning to hire someone to build your iOS mobile app.

So unless you’re planning to take a trip to Indonesia, it won’t be inexpensive. On average, an app will take about 7-9 months to build and cost you about $270,000. That’s an unrealistic number for some businesses.
Your company may not even be able to secure a $200,000 line of credit, never mind pay over $250,000 for an app.
So what’s the solution?
There are some great resources online that teach you how to code for free. I’ll show you my favourite ones. Team Treehouse offers a free trial for a week to new users. So you can learn to code from your computer, anywhere with a Wi-Fi connection.
Here’s how their system works. They have thousands of videos to teach users the basics of coding. After you watch the videos, you’ll take quizzes to test your knowledge. 

Code Academy is another one of my favourites.

For small business who are just interested in converting their existing website to a mobile app, they can take advantage of the "Krowser Web Services App Development Support Program" 
You just need to submit your business website link and an android app will be developed and published on the Google Play Store all for free.
The whole process typically takes 7 days.
Submit your website here: https://forms.gle/jExGTmyvv2hgFcfF7
Creating an android app for your business is much easier than it sounds.
Depending on your situation, you’ve got lots of options to choose from.]]></summary>

A fundamental building block for Javascript programs. Most common feature in all programming languages. What exactly is a function in technical terms? a function is a block of code that is defined once, can be executed or invoked numerous times. Functions are also objects so they can be manipulated by other programs too. 
We declare a function by using the function keyword, following by a name of our liking, followed by a pair of opening and closing parentheses, an optional but recommended for best practice is to have a space for readability between the parameters and the curly braces with zero or more statements inside.

While NextJS is a powerful tool in its own right, adding Express to it makes for a really powerful combo.
You may want to add a custom API to your application without spinning up a separate API service, or you may want to take control of routing, or run some middleware and fetch standard data for your pages before they are served. Perhaps you have an existing API server and you wish to enable it to serve some front end.
This type of set up is documented in NextJS itself: https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server
In the standard example, they use Node's http package; we'll use Express to take advantage of its middleware and routing capabilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata]]></summary>

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a "pseudo" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
