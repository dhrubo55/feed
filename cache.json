It allows us to compute how similar a text corpus and a picture are.\nIf we can compute a similarity score between a text corpus and a picture, we can build a simple search engine. Imagine we had a million pictures of cute animals.\n1- The user would type a query, let's say, \"cats with hats\".\nEt voilà!\nHowever, because we are computing the similarity score on each image, the search time will keep growing with the number of images. It is not scalable.\nAlso, search engines usually allow multiple facets search (for example, the image's primary color) in conjunction with the text query.\nTo improve our implementation, let understand how CLIP work.\n(Coming in Part 2)",
