                    <span>Last year I&#x27;ve worked on a project where I had to develop a small game alongside other components. But recently I&#x27;ve decided to isolate this game as a single stand-alone project since it was a good way to share a bit about canvas development and possibly introduce someone that Canvas API.
This article is intended to detail the development process of the game and some fundamentals of how to deal with Canvas API for similar projects.
First things first, you can take a look at the GitHub Project ‚≠ê or just play the game üéÆ.
Before jumping into coding, we must have some things clear in mind, such as the concept of the game, the goal, how to win, and how to lose. If you have played it already, you&#x27;ve probably got it, but here is a quick overview:

Hello üëã, Beautiful Coders on the internet üòÉ. In this article, I would share with you a quick yet comprehensive overview of how the most popular and widely used programming language in the world evolved to be what it is today.
Over the years JavaScript has become the most popular and versatile programming language. Powering over 97% of the web. As a web developer knowing the history of the most popular and in-demand programming language is a plus that will help enhance your understanding of the language.
Back in May 1995, the internet was becoming popular. The web back then was just static pages that were often text-heavy and ugly üòå.
the best ones had images floated to the left or right. Not exciting when you compare it to the web today ü§î

                    <span>Definition of selection sort


Selection sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms, it works by continually finding the minimum number in the array and inserting it at the beginning.
The time complexity of selection sort is O(n2) and it&#x27;s space complexity is O(1)
itertate from 0 to len(arr) - 1 
seting to minimunIdx variable the first element index in the unsorted part 
loop trough the unsorted part

                    <span>The web is full of gradient generators. So I thought I&#x27;d make another one: Not Another Gradient Generator
It has some novel features though:
Generates linear, radial, and conic gradients.
Allows you to layer gradients to make complex designs.
Automatically adds colors to prevent gradients looking washed out.
Exports gradients as CSS, SVG, PNG, and JPEG.
I started this project with the goal of being able to replicate the instagram logo gradient in CSS. The instagram logo isn&#x27;t a simple linear or radial gradient. It&#x27;s complex and made by clever graphic designers using expensive software.
But CSS allows us to layer gradients on top of each other, by combining radial and linear gradients you can approximate the same thing:

This almost looks like it, the main issue is that it&#x27;s all washed out.‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Sanity is often described as a &quot;headless CMS&quot;‚Äîa content management system decoupled from its presentation, allowing a developer to create any kind of frontend they desire.
But most &quot;headless CMS&quot; platforms are rather limited in what they can accomplish. They&#x27;re usually designed to be blogs, e-commerce stores, or marketing pages‚Äîtry and do something more avant-garde and you may soon find yourself in the weeds.
Not so with Sanity! With its thoughtful developer experience and lightning-fast APIs, Sanity can also compare favorably to &quot;managed databases&quot; such as Firebase and Supabase. Systems like these are designed for more complex, technical applications that require user authentication and dynamically presented data. Sanity can hold its own here!

You&#x27;re already storing structured data in the database, it seems only logical to store files in there as well.
So you look up how to save files in MongoDB (or PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.), only to find out that storing files in the database is considered bad practice.
Other web developers are saying that you shouldn&#x27;t store files in the database, and they&#x27;ll frown upon you if you ask them how to.
But nobody tells you why...
Is it because it looks bad to have a very long base64 string in the database?
There has to be more to it than that.
By the end of this article, you&#x27;ll find out why saving files in the database is considered a bad practice.
You will discover common downsides‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>One benefit of moving business logic to Temporal is how Temporal implements retries and timeouts for Activities in a standardized way. This has the effect of adding a reliability layer atop unreliable Activities and Workers, in a durable and scalable fashion. However, understanding the terminology can be a bit intimidating at first glance. 
This post (together with the embedded talk) aims to give you a solid mental model on what each Activity timeout does and when to use it.
Note: You can also set Workflow timeouts and retry policies you can set. This post deals only with Activity timeouts.
You can watch this 18 minute talk where our CEO Maxim Fateev explains the 4 Types of Activity timeouts you see in Temporal.

                    <span>While web builders have been around for a long time, it wasn‚Äôt until recently that they became practical for professional use. Closing the gap between design and code has become the north star for many companies and we are seeing a wave of tools that deliver on this promise.</span>

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>
