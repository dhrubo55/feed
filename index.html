                    <span>Most of use JSON.stringify a lot to avoid the infamous &quot;[object Object]&quot;. But did you know that it had a few more arguments?
JSON.stringify takes a total of 3 arguments. The first one is the data, the second is a replacer function, and the third one is the indentation.
The main topic of this article is the third argument. If you provide a string as the third argument, that string will be used as indentation. Here&#x27;s an example:
JSON.stringify({a: &#x27;B&#x27;, c: {d: &#x27;e&#x27;}})
// &#x3D;&gt; {&quot;a&quot;:&quot;B&quot;,&quot;c&quot;:{&quot;d&quot;:&quot;e&quot;}}
JSON.stringify({a: &#x27;B&#x27;, c: {d: &#x27;e&#x27;}}, null, &quot;  &quot;)
// &#x3D;&gt; 
// {
//   &quot;a&quot;: &quot;B&quot;,
//   &quot;c&quot;: {
//     &quot;d&quot;: &quot;e&quot;
//   }
// }
JSON.stringify({a: &#x27;B&#x27;, c: {d: &#x27;e&#x27;}}, null, &quot;test&quot;)
// &#x3D;&gt;
// {
// test&quot;a&quot;: &quot;B&quot;,
// test&quot;c&quot;: {
// testtest&quot;d&quot;: &quot;e&quot;
// test}
// }

You can also pass in a number instead. If you do so, that many spaces will be inserted as indentation:
JSON.stringify({a: &#x27;B&#x27;, c: {d: &#x27;e&#x27;}}, null, 2)
// &#x3D;&gt; 
// {
//   &quot;a&quot;: &quot;B&quot;,
//   &quot;c&quot;: {
//     &quot;d&quot;: &quot;e&quot;
//   }
// }

Hope this helps you while debugging sometime!</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Recently at work, We were looking for a way to generate unique IDs across a distributed system that could also be used as the primary keys in the MySQL tables.
We knew in a single MySQL database we can simply use an auto-increment ID as the primary key, But this won’t work in a sharded MySQL database.
So I looked at various existing solutions for this and finally learned about Twitter Snowflake - a simple 64-bit unique ID generator.
UUIDs are 128-bit hexadecimal numbers that are globally unique. The chances of the same UUID getting generated twice are negligible.
The problem with UUIDs is that they are very big in size and don’t index well. When your dataset increases, the index size increases as well and the query performance degrades.
Another problem with UUIDs is related …</span>

                    <span>Are you tired of scanning images and trying to shrink them under 25 mbs just so you can send them via email ? Look no further, I am here to save you from this trouble. (that kinda rhymed.)
This basic shell script uses ghostscript to compress your scanned pdfs significantly. Just yesterday I scanned 100 pages of documents and it was over 90 mbs. I searched for a way to compress them under 25 mbs and voila. Here I was with only 6 mbs of pdfs. Much wow. Such compression.
Why we need it,
Fast.
Ez.
No need to go online. Especially no need to upload company top-secret documents to any website you see on the Internet.
Possible huge compression without notable loss.
Command usage:
./shrinkpdf.sh in.pdf out.pdf
ghostscript.





If you are in a situation exactly like me where there are 100 pdf files under one folder that you want to compress altogether, a simple for loop will suffice.
import os
import subprocess
import sys

infolder &#x3D; sys.argv[1]
outfolder &#x3D; &quot;compressed_&quot; + infolder
os.mkdir(outfolder)

for f in os.listdir(infolder):
    subprocess.run([&quot;./shrinkpdf.sh&quot;, os.path.join(infolder, f), os.path.join(outfolder, f)])

Run this python script,
python shrink.py pdfs/
and all of your pdfs will be put under compressed_pdfs/.

Proto DataStore different? 🤔


While both Preferences and Proto DataStore allow saving data, they do this in different ways. One important feature is applied only when using Proto DataStore, and it is Type Safety. 
With Proto DataStore we don&#x27;t have to use keys. Instead we define a schema using Protocol Buffers. And with Protocol Buffers we can persist strongly typed data.
One of the downsides of SharedPreferences and Preferences DataStore is that there is no way to ensure that keys are accessed with the correct type. Using Proto DataStore, we know what types are stored and we will just provide them.
Protocol Buffers were developed by Go…</span>

                    <span>Hi,
If you’re a web developer, you need a web hosting provider that offers the cheapest hosting plan, best hosting features, and as well as excellent support and full backend access.
I recommend 4 web hosting company that can serve you faster and reliably each time so that your website visitors can have a great experience.
Cloudways - 3 Days Free



Cloudways is a managed hosting provider that emphasizes performance and simplicity. From the simple server and application launch to the ongoing server maintenance, Cloudways takes away all the hassles of server management so that you can continue to focus on growing your business.
Linode - 100$ Free Credit



Linode is a cloud hosting provider that focuses on providing Linux powered virtual machines to support a wide range of applications. Given its roots, many experts do not see it as a beginner-friendly.
DigitalOcean - 100$ Free Credit



DigitalOcean is a cloud infrastructure provider that provides cloud computing services to business entities. It is used to scale by deploying DigitalOcean applications that run parallel across multiple cloud servers without compromising performance.
Vultr - 100$ Free Credit



Vultr provides high-performance SSD cloud servers that boast a global footprint. It aims to create the most reliable and efficient service for launching a blazing fast SSD cloud server.
I tried these 4 hosting presonally for my sites and every hosting perform well but cloud hosting provider doesn&#x27;t provide contact support only for server, no extra support.
If you want good contact support and security in cloud hosting then i recommend Cloudways.
If you manage complete server and server security from your own then you can go with any hosting listed above but i recommend Linode.
I hope you will choose right hosting :)</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Hey now, you have probably went through numerous job-hunting websites and you memorized all the buzzwords (Junior Sysadmin; Junior Site Reliability Engineer; NOC Engineer; System support; etc.) that can get you in IT with zero experience, or even zero education. Well, let me tell you - you are on the right track! However, there are some insights that a lot of you don&#x27;t know as you haven&#x27;t got a real Linux job. Well now, except you are on the right track, you are on the post, as well!
I am going to note down &amp; explain the top 10 Linux skills (in the opinion of a person who had a Linux job as a first) that you should have before rushing into the interview.

                    <span>In terms of a pandemic situation, many large companies were forced to take all their processes online. So, they need someone who can build an enterprise-level server-side application, create website content, and keep up maintaining it promptly. In this case, many projects choose Java to build the apps and, consequently, need as many Java programmers as possible to implement that. So, if you still ask yourself “Why should I learn Java”, this is supposed to be an answer.
But, this is not the only reason, and I will explain why becoming a Java developer in 2021 is a fresh start.
Right before considering the other reasons for starting to master Java, it makes sense, to begin with fundamentals and discover what’s so good about becoming a programmer.

The blockchain terms; token and cryptocurrency are often used interchangeably, as these are both digital assets on blockchains. The biggest difference between a cryptocurrency and a token is that cryptocurrencies are the native asset of a

blockchain like BTC, RBTC, or ETH, whereas tokens are built on an existing blockchain, using smart contracts. Most commonly, these are EIP-20 tokens.

                    <span>The Linux command line is for power users. It is not for the faint of heart or for people who are afraid to take a risk. 
If you are new to Linux and are afraid to take the plunge into using the command line interface, then this tutorial is a good start. 
Linux is an open source operating system that is used on everything from smart phones to main frame computers. 
Linux provides a command line interface (CLI) that provides a quick and powerful way to control and manipulate your computer. Once mastered, the Linux CLI can save you time and provide a powerful tool to aid in your daily tasks.
The command line can be intimidating but learning the basics will give you access to a world of scripts and automation tools that will make your life a lot easier and more productive.
The Basics: You will be using the command line to type various commands and tasks. Commands are what Linux runs. In Linux, the Command Line can be used for various things.

To start, open up a terminal. Now, let&#x27;s try using some basic Linux commands! 
Most of these commands are applicable for all Linux distributions. Linux is case sensitive (capitalization matters).
Navigation
ls    List directory
cd DIR Change the current directory to the DIR directory
cd ~  Change to home directory
cd /      Change the current directory to the root directory
cd ..     Go one directory lower
pwd   Show name of current working directory 
File Commands
mkdir -p DIR Create directory DIR 
rm FILE Remove FILE
rm -r DIR Remove DIR and its contents recursively
rm -f FILE Force remove FILE 
System Info
date  Print or set the system date and time
cal   Displays a calendar
uptime Tell how long the system has been running
w     Show who is logged on and what they are doing
whoami  Print effective userid</span>

                    <span>Version 2.4 of Foal has been released! Here are the improvements that it brings.
$data references for validation


Version 2.4 allows you to enable the AJV $data option so that you can use the verified data values as validators for other values.
config/default.json
{
  &quot;settings&quot;: {
    &quot;ajv&quot;: {
      &quot;$data&quot;: true
    }
  }
}

Example of auth controller
import { Context, Post, ValidateBody } from &#x27;@foal/core&#x27;;

export class AuthController {
  @Post(&#x27;/signup&#x27;)
  @ValidateBody({
    type: &#x27;object&#x27;,
    properties: {
      username: { type: &#x27;string&#x27; },
      password: { type: &#x27;string&#x27; },
      // &quot;password&quot; and &quot;confirmPassword&quot; should be identical.
      confirmPassword: {
        const: {
          $data: &#x27;1/password&#x27;,
        },
        type: &#x27;string&#x27;,
      },
    }
    required: [ &#x27;username&#x27;, &#x27;password&#x27;, &#x27;confirmPassword&#x27; ],
    additionalProperties: false
  })
  signup(ctx: Context) {
    // Do something.
  }
}


Starting from version 2.4 the Disk.createHttpResponse method accepts an optional parameter to specify the value of the Cache-Control header.
import { Context, dependency, Get } from &#x27;@foal/core&#x27;;
import { Disk } from &#x27;@foal/storage&#x27;;

import { User } from &#x27;../entities&#x27;;

export class ProfileController {
  @dependency
  disk: Disk;

  @Get(&#x27;/avatar&#x27;)
  async readProfileImage(ctx: Context) {
    return this.disk.createHttpResponse(ctx.user.avatar, {
      cache: &#x27;no-cache&#x27;
    });
  }

                    <span>Monkey patching is one of Ruby&#x27;s most powerful features. It allows programmers to add methods to core classes which can result in some very elegant APIs. However it&#x27;s quite easy to shoot yourself in the foot if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.  
This post from Justin Weiss is a brilliant guide on how to monkey patch responsibly. However he doesn&#x27;t describe how to actually include your monkey patches in a Rails app, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to describe in this post.  
Following Justin&#x27;s advice, the implementation of all our monkey patches should go in the lib/core_extensions directory. So we might have some files like this:  
lib/core_extensions/array.rb
module CoreExtensions
  module Array
    def to_set

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
