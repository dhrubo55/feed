This tiny change already requires restructuring the code a bit, as getting this information in node is - obviously async.
let { readdir } = require("fs/promises")

let directoryContents = async (path) => {
  let results = await readdir(path, {withFileTypes: true})
  return await Promise.all(results.map(entry => fileInfo(path, entry)))

I'm not sure how node actually executes it. Pretty much every other language will run system calls one at a time, so we could do return results.map(entry => await fileInfo(path, entry)), but on an off chance that this actually runs in parallel I'm first constructing big …]]></summary>

React Native + Redux + NodeJs + MongoDB Atlas + Heroku = Daily Discomfort
Daily Discomfort is an app that allows users to swipe on different prompts that are designed to get them out of their comfort zones. After the user swipes right on a prompt their mission is to go out into the real word to complete the challenge. Once completed, or failed, the user comes back to the app to journal about their experiences trying to complete the prompt.  It can be found on  the Apple AppStore & Google Play Store.

The whole reason that I created this app is because I recognize I am terrified to get out of my own comfort zone. I wanted something that would force me each and every day to try something new and to experience things that I might have not had the chance to otherwise. After real…]]></summary>

HNG Internship is a virtual internship program for people learning to code or design. It usually runs for around 3 months. 
The program has 10 stages. Those who are able to fulfill the given tasks within a stated timeframe advance to the next stage.
HNGi8 is the eighth cohort of the program and it's organized by the Zuri Team.
I've read a lot about HNG on Twitter and how its finalist turns out to be prodigies. And also how it's challenging and fast-paced.  I  wanted to challenge myself with the intent to be among the finalists.
Learn how to work in a team. - As a self-taught, I don't have much experience working in teams.


Meet and connect with other developers and designers.


Work on challenging projects to improve my skills.


Access to Job opportunities - HNG matches finalists to its pool of potential employers.

  Some Learning Resources I find Useful


As a self-taught, I use a lot of resources while honing my front-end development skills. Some of the beginner-friendly ones I find includes:
HTML & CSS - Kevin Powell's HTML & CSS Playlist on Youtube.


Figma - Getting started with Figma Video by Kevin Powell.


Git - Git Tutorial for Beginners by Mos on Youtube.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, I started working on a really fun side project: a natural language image search engine.

Try it.
The idea came after reading about Open AI's CLIP. 
CLIP is a neural network able to connect text and images. It allows us to compute how similar a text corpus and a picture are.
If we can compute a similarity score between a text corpus and a picture, we can build a simple search engine. Imagine we had a million pictures of cute animals.
1- The user would type a query, let's say, "cats with hats".
Et voilà!
However, because we are computing the similarity score on each image, the search time will keep growing with the number of images. It is not scalable.
Also, search engines usually allow multiple facets search (for example, the image's primary color) in conjunction with the text query.
To improve our implementation, let understand how CLIP work.

Tailwind CSS styles your applications by using utilities. Utilities are just specific class names that relate to some css property and value. This is great till you have tons of utilities listed like below.

Arithmetic operators
Ternary operators
Logical operators
Comparison operators

Bitwise operators
We commonly use most of these operators in our routine but sparingly use bitwise operator especially if you just getting started with JavaScript.
