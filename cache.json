That would look like:\npublic function myMethod() {\n    if ($this->dryrun) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Execute destructive code...\n}\n\nThis puts a little too much pressure on each function to know about what a dry-run even is, how to check against it, and it couples logic too directly.\nThe approach I’ve chosen to use instead utilizes PHP’s magic __call() to help make better determinations; much of Laravel uses this as well.\n--\nFor my commands, I have a BaseCommand.php …",
